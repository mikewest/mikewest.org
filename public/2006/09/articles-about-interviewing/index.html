  <p>I&rsquo;m currently boning up on interview lore in preparation for one I&rsquo;ve got coming up in a few weeks (speaking of which, if you&rsquo;ll be in Munich on the 13th, drop me a line; First beer&rsquo;s on me!).  I&rsquo;m ignoring the &ldquo;big name&rdquo; interview advice sites today (though <a href="http://www.techinterview.org/" title="techInterview">techinterview</a> looks like a promising avenue for tomorrow&hellip;), instead using the magic of <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/" title="NetNewsWire: _The_ RSS Reader for OS X">NetNewsWire</a> to dive back through my RSS feeds to find articles and essays that were written by people I read and respect.  A little research has yielded the following (very) short list of interview essays that I think are worth reading, whether you&rsquo;re prepping for an interview, or trying to figure out <em>how to</em> interview: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Steve Yegge has a number of excellent essays up, recounting his
experiences interviewing candidates for software developer positions at
Amazon.  The best of these is 
&ldquo;<a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/five-essential-phone-screen-questions" title="Steve Yegge: 'Five Essential Phone Screen Questions'">Five Essential Phone Screen Questions</a>&rdquo;, which outlines
in great detail the critical areas to check for as early as possible in
the interview process.  It&rsquo;s well written, and seems dead-on in terms of
the areas it recommends.  </p>

    <p>He&rsquo;s also written &ldquo;<a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/practical-magic" title="Steve Yegge: 'Practical Magic'">Practical Magic</a>&rdquo;, exploring the question
of abstraction (which is directly applicable to the danger of
over-reliance on frameworks and JavaScript libraries); 
&ldquo;<a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/what-you-need-to-know" title="Steve Yegge: 'What You Need To Know'">What You Need To Know</a>&rdquo;, espousing the virtues of
interviewing for &lsquo;common sense&rsquo;; and more recently 
&ldquo;<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2006/03/interviewing_ruby_programmers.html" title="Steve Yegge: 'Interviewing Ruby Programmers'">Interviewing Ruby Programmers</a>&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s followup
&ldquo;<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/truth-about-interviewing.html" title="Steve Yegge: 'Truth About Interviewing'">The Truth About Interviewing</a>&rdquo;, arguing (among other
things) that programming is <em>hard</em>, and that interviewees shouldn&rsquo;t be
surprised or offended when companies&rsquo; interview process sets a very high
standard for acceptance.</p>

    <p>And really, <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com" title="Steve Yegge: 'Stevey's Blog Rants'">Steve&rsquo;s blog</a> and his 
<a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/blog-rants" title="Stevey's Drunken Blog Rants">collection of older essays</a> are well worth reading no matter what
you&rsquo;re looking for, he&rsquo;s an entertaining and insightful guy.</p>

    <p><em>[Edited 2006-09-28: Steve moved servers and didn&rsquo;t set up 301 redirects, so I updated the links manually.]</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Joel Spolsky (of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" title="Joel on Software">Joel on Software</a> fame) has an essay
up entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000073.html" title="Joel Spolsky: 'The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing'">The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing</a>&rdquo;, which is both a
great example of why I enjoy reading Joel&rsquo;s writing, but also a wonderful
resource for technical interviews.  Though this essay is geared towards
the <em>interviewer</em>, his advice and expectations are easily applicable to
the <em>interviewee</em>.  He covers much of the same ground as Steve&rsquo;s essays, 
though of course with his own spin, and offers some great tidbits about
what he&rsquo;s looking for, and what he finds impressive.</p>

    <p>His essay &ldquo;<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ResumeRead.html" title="Joel Spolsky: 'Getting Your Résumé Read'">Getting Your Résumé Read</a>&rdquo; looks like a keeper as
well, though it wasn&rsquo;t exactly what I was looking for.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Do you know of any good articles I should add to the list?</p>
