  <p>Interviews for technical positions are tough, both for the interviewer and the interviewee.  The interviewer has the impossible task of evaluating someone&rsquo;s competence on a wide range of complex subjects in just a few hours.  The interviewee has the equally impossible task of proving that she&rsquo;s smarter than the average bear within the same tight time constraints.  Really, it&rsquo;s a wonder anyone ever gets hired at all.</p>

<p>There are no hard and fast rules you can follow to guarantee success in an interview.  </p>

<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-a-web-development-interview">The Anatomy of a Web Development Interview</h2>

<p>Interviews are tough, especially interviews for technical positions.  The interviewer wants to get a good feel for your problem-solving ability, and you want to answer questions as quickly and correctly as possible so that you give the best possible impression.  I interviewed for a web development position a little while back, and in this brief series of articles, I want to talk a little bit about a few of the more interesting questions I got asked, and the process by which I came up with an answer.</p>

<p>The first task focuses on JavaScript and the DOM, here it is: &ldquo;<strong>Write a function that returns an array containing all the elements on a page having a specified attribute.</strong>&rdquo;  Given that, where do you start?</p>

<h2 id="prove-that-youre-an-expert">Prove That You&rsquo;re an Expert</h2>

<p>The first thing to realize when you&rsquo;ve in a good technical interview is that the answer you come up with probably matters less than you think.  It&rsquo;s important that you end up with some code that works, but the interviewer is typically more concerned with <em>how</em> you get to the answer, and <em>why</em> you went that route.  </p>

<p>When you get a question, don&rsquo;t start by grabbing a marker and scribbling on the whiteboard.  Step back a bit, and talk about the problem with the interviewer.  Make sure that you understand the task, and that the interviewer <em>knows</em> that you understand it, before diving in.  If nothing else, this discussion is a good opportunity for you to point out everything you <em>do</em> know, even if you&rsquo;re (for the moment) clueless as to how to solve the actual question at hand.</p>

<p>So, we might begin by talking about the similarities between the function we&rsquo;ve been asked for and some built in DOM methods:  &ldquo;Well, Ms. Interviewer, we&rsquo;ve got <code>getElementsByTagName</code> which gives us an array of all the elements of a specific type, and we&rsquo;ve got <code>getElementById</code> to get a specific element.  But neither of those seems immediately useful, so it looks like we&rsquo;ll have to write some code to hit every element on the DOM tree and test whether it has the attribute we&rsquo;re looking for.&rdquo;  We haven&rsquo;t gotten much closer to the goal, but we&rsquo;re <em>talking intelligently</em> about the DOM.  We&rsquo;re giving the clear impression that we <em>know what we&rsquo;re talking about</em> (hey, he knows that the DOM is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29" title="Wikipedia: 'Tree (Data Structure)'">tree</a>!), which counts for a lot in the interview.</p>

<p>From there, we need to come up with a plan of attack, so start discussing the algorithms you might choose to solve the problem you&rsquo;ve just described.  You need to hit every DOM node on the tree&hellip; How could you do it?  In my interview, I latched onto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion" title="Wikipedia: 'Recursion'">recursion</a>, both because it was the first thing that came to mind, and because [smart people][] consider recursion to be an important skill to test for:  &ldquo;Well, generally speaking, we need to traverse a tree, hitting every node on the way.  It makes sense to do that recursively, starting at the top, and walking the tree depth-first, then sticking all the results into a big array to give back to the function&rsquo;s caller.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="apply-your-expertise">Apply Your Expertise</h2>

<p>At this point, we&rsquo;ve established that we more or less know what we&rsquo;re talking about, and outlined the general process by which we&rsquo;ll attack the problem.  Now we need to turn that general algorithm into a specific solution for our problem.</p>
