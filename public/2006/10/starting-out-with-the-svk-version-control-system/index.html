  <p>I have the distinct impression that I&rsquo;m going to be playing with a lot of CVS repositories in the near future, and I&rsquo;m not exactly thrilled about the idea.  I&rsquo;ve been almost exclusively using SVN for the last year or two, and it&rsquo;s going to be a bit of a leap to &ldquo;revert&rdquo; to CVS for version control.  I&rsquo;m hoping that <a href="http://svk.elixus.org/" title="SVK Version Control System">SVK</a> will be able to help me bridge the conceptual gap.</p>

<p>SVK is a decentralized version control system, based on Subversion.  The piece that interests me is it&rsquo;s ability to sit on top of a variety of repositories, providing a single interface to all of them regardless of server.  The ability to map SVN-like commands to a CVS repository, for example, is very interesting.  I have no idea if it will work, and I haven&rsquo;t found a whole lot of material online about others&rsquo; success or failure, so I&rsquo;ll just play around with it myself and see if I can get it going anywhere.  </p>

<h2 id="installing-svk-on-os-x">Installing SVK on OS X</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/hiirem/SVK-1.07-1.dmg">packaged SVK installer for OS X</a> that you can download and run.  I generally prefer to compile things myself, but the package is probably the best option; the command line install for SVK is more annoying than usual.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a nut, and want to install from the command line, then type:</p>

<pre><code>curl -O http://homepage.mac.com/hiirem/svkbuild-1.07-1.tar.bz2
bunzip2 ./svkbuild-1.07-1.tar.bz2
tar -xvf ./svkbuild-1.07-1.tar
cd svkbuild-1.07-1
sudo mkdir /usr/local/svk-`cat VERSION`
sudo chown $USER /usr/local/svk-`cat VERSION`
./build.sh
</code></pre>

<p><code>build.sh</code> uses CPAN to install some required Perl modules.  It&rsquo;ll ask for confirmation before pulling them down, so you&rsquo;ll have to babysit the installation a bit to hit enter at the appropriate times.  That&rsquo;s more than a little annoying.  I hope that gets cleaned up in the future, because it&rsquo;s driving me nuts.  :)</p>

<h2 id="references">References</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll continue populating this section as I read more about SVK.  For now, I&rsquo;m starting with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://svkbook.elixus.org/" title="Version Control with SVK">Version Control with SVK</a> is <em>the</em> resource for SVK.  It&rsquo;s
fairly complete, but still very much a work in progress.</li>
</ul>
