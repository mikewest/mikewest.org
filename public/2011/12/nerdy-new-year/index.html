  <p>New Year&rsquo;s resolutions come in all shapes and sizes; if you&rsquo;re a web
developer stuck for good ideas of things you could do to improve the world
(or at least the tiny chunk of it that&rsquo;s concerned with web performance and
security) I&rsquo;d like to propose two: secure user&rsquo;s connections to all your
websites, and use a cookieless domain for static assets.</p>

<h2 id="ssl-everywhere">SSL Everywhere.</h2>

<p>If you look closely, you&rsquo;ll notice that <code>mikewest.org</code> is being served via a
secure connection: <code>https</code> rather than <code>http</code>. This is a Good Thingâ„¢, for
reasons which I explored <a href="https://mikewest.org/2011/10/http-strict-transport-security-and-you">earlier this year</a>. I&rsquo;d like to suggest that each
of you pop open Firefox (yes, Firefox) and head to <a href="https://www.startssl.com/">StartSSL</a> where you can,
<em>for free</em>, create an account, verify your ownership of a domain, and generate
an SSL certificate.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve moved to StartSSL for every domain I own that hosts a website. It&rsquo;s
trivially easy, very well supported (I&rsquo;ve never waited more than 18 hours for a
response to a support request), and works well in every browser I care about.
Moreover, it&rsquo;s run by real people who you can email. I&rsquo;ve gotten responses from
the founder himself at two in the morning; the service is brilliant.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d suggest, actually, going through the extra step of verifying your identity
with them so that you can generate wildcard certificates, and certificates
with DNS alt names: both will make it easier for you to host SSL websites
without the annoyance of setting up separate IP addresses for each host.
They charge $59.90 for the verification, at which point you can create as many
certificates as you like. It&rsquo;s a heck of a deal.</p>

<p>And hey, while you&rsquo;re at it, start serving <a href="https://mikewest.org/2011/10/http-strict-transport-security-and-you"><code>Strict-Transport-Security</code></a>
headers too!</p>

<h2 id="cookieless-domains-for-static-assets">Cookieless domains for static assets</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard at some point in the past that it&rsquo;s a <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/request.html#ServeFromCookielessDomain">good</a> <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#cookie_free">idea</a>
to serve static assets from a domain that doesn&rsquo;t set cookies. Yesterday, I
finally got around to doing that here. If you hop into devtools or Firebug,
you&rsquo;ll see that this page&rsquo;s CSS, JavaScript, and images are all being served
not from <code>mikewest.org</code>, but from <code>mikewestdotorg.hasacdn.net</code>. Setting up an
alias like this is trivial in any server. Here&rsquo;s how I made it work in Nginx:</p>

<p>My websites all have specific directories in which static assets live,
<code>/home/mkwst/public_html/mikewest.org/public/static</code> for example. I simply set
up a server listening for requests to <code>mikewestdotorg.hasacdn.net</code>, and use
the static asset directory as the <code>root</code>. With that in place, I ensure that all
files are served with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#expires">far-future expiry headers</a>, and then set up some
trivial versioning magic by ignoring the first chunk of the URL:
<code>https://mikewestdotorg.hasacdn.net/20111231/style.css</code> serves the same file
as <code>https://mikewestdotorg.hasacdn.net/1/style.css</code>, but because the 
paths are different, the file can be loaded and cached anew when something
changes.</p>

<p>That setup looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>server {
  listen 80;
  server_name mikewestdotorg.hasacdn.net;

  # Turn off logging for static assets:
  access_log  off;
  error_log   /dev/null crit;

  # Set the root from which Nginx reads files for this domain:
  root /home/mkwst/public_html/mikewest.org/public/static;

  location / {
    add_header Expires "Thu, 31 Dec 2037 23:55:55 GMT";
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=315360000";
    
    if (-f $request_filename) {
      break;
    }

    rewrite ^/\d+/(.*) /$1 break;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Easy! I&rsquo;ve thrown <a href="https://github.com/mikewest/hasacdn.net/blob/master/private/nginx.conf">the whole config file up on GitHub</a> if you&rsquo;re curious. </p>

<p>So there you have it; enjoy the end of your holidays with these two resolutions
that you can bang out over the weekend. You&rsquo;ll be ahead of the game, and the
envy of all your friends and neighbors when you compare notes at the end of
2012.</p>
