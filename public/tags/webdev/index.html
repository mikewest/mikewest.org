        <p>New Year&rsquo;s resolutions come in all shapes and sizes; if you&rsquo;re a web developer stuck for good ideas of things you could do to improve the world (or at least the tiny chunk of it that&rsquo;s concerned with web performance and security) I&rsquo;d like to propose two: secure all your websites, and use a cookieless domain for static assets.</p>

        <p>I sat down with Technikwürze&rsquo;s Marcel Böttcher way back at the beginning of February to talk about the exciting new release of Chrome 9 to the stable channel, and a few other bits and pieces of the Chrome ecosystem. That interview (in German) is just now seeing the light of day as Technikwürze 178.  After listening to it last night, I think it generally went pretty well, modulo a few small mistakes on my part.</p>

        <p>Yesterday at the Silicon Valley GTUG meetup, I gave a presentation introducing the IndexedDB API.  I&rsquo;ve thrown the slides on Slideshare, but the transcription there is absolutely miserable.  I&rsquo;ll reproduce it here in a readable format, and add a few notes where appropriate.</p>

        <p>One question you&rsquo;re almost certainly not asking yourself is &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Mike West been up to?&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s a shame, really, as I&rsquo;ve got some projects floating around that I&rsquo;m proud of, and that I&rsquo;d like to share with you. Moreover, I&rsquo;d like to point out the project documentation pages that I&rsquo;ve put together as a meta-project; I think it&rsquo;s worth your time to take a look.</p>

        <p>One of the few tools that I consider truly indispensable when developing websites is JSLint.  Too bad it&rsquo;s almost impossible to contribute back to the project, and that the project&rsquo;s run by someone who &ldquo;will hurt your feelings.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Jekyll is a well-architected throwback to a time before Wordpress, when men were men, and HTML was static.  I like the ideas it espouses, and have made a few improvements to it&rsquo;s core.  Here, I&rsquo;ll point out some highlights of my fork in the hopes that they see usage beyond this site.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m currently in the process of gutting my website, and rebuilding it piece by piece.  I suspect I&rsquo;m doing this to distract myself from the fact that I don&rsquo;t seem to have anything interesting floating around my head to write about. Rather that catalog the failings of the system I&rsquo;m replacing (for they are legion), in this article I&rsquo;d like to touch on the carefully considered bits I&rsquo;m keeping around.</p>

        <p>While I agree fully with many of the conclusions Lukas Mathis draws in an excellent essay on the recent Google/Douglas Bowman split, a few bits deserve further study.  In general, engineers understand and can relate well to automated A/B testing, and designers understand and can relate well to more personal usability testing.  The two are, however, not the same, don&rsquo;t provide the same data, and ought not be conflated.</p>

        <p>Varnish is an excellent-looking &lsquo;HTTP accelerator&rsquo;, designed specifically as a high-performance caching reverse-proxy to sit in front of your hard-working application servers, and relieve them of load.  It&rsquo;s a bit of a pain in the ass to install from source on JeOS, though.</p>

        <p>So.  W3C has quite decent installation instructions for the HTML validator, but it makes a few assumptions about a typical linux environment that don&rsquo;t actually hold true if you&rsquo;re running a stripped down JeOS distro in a virtual machine.</p>

        <p>On the bus home from work, I was listening to this week&rsquo;s On the Media. In particular, I was struck by a great interview with the man who designed the field-organizer and volunteer training programs for Barack Obama&rsquo;s campaign: Marshall Ganz.  If you&rsquo;re at all interested in the political angle, I&rsquo;d suggest you listen.  If you&rsquo;re at all interested in how I&rsquo;m planning to apply this seemingly unrelated topic to the technical field of web development (et al), keep reading.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m trying to do something with the Flickr API that I consider to be relatively trivial. I have the impression that the API is fighting me every step of the way. Why, oh why, can&rsquo;t the wonderful people who designed Del.icio.us&rsquo;s new API hop over to Flickr and slap together something that makes sense from the perspective of the end user?</p>

        <p>Nginx is a brilliant little HTTP server that I&rsquo;m using on this website to quickly serve static content.  It bothers me a (very) little that it doesn&rsquo;t correctly generate Etag headers for static content, however.  I&rsquo;m attempting to remedy that oversight by releasing an Nginx module: <code>nginx-static-etags</code>.</p>

For the sake of my own sanity, I need to start working on personal projects again.  Last week&rsquo;s GitHub dump was the first step in that direction.  Consider this relaunch to be the second.</p>
