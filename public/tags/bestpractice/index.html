        <p>One question you&rsquo;re almost certainly not asking yourself is &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Mike West been up to?&rdquo;  That&rsquo;s a shame, really, as I&rsquo;ve got some projects floating around that I&rsquo;m proud of, and that I&rsquo;d like to share with you. Moreover, I&rsquo;d like to point out the project documentation pages that I&rsquo;ve put together as a meta-project; I think it&rsquo;s worth your time to take a look.</p>

        <p>One of the few tools that I consider truly indispensable when developing websites is JSLint.  Too bad it&rsquo;s almost impossible to contribute back to the project, and that the project&rsquo;s run by someone who &ldquo;will hurt your feelings.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Progressive enhancement of our sites and applications has become a relatively well accepted best practice for web development.  This article outlines a technique I&rsquo;ve used successfully to ensure that core functionality is available without JavaScript, while maintaining a quality experience for the majority of users with JavaScript enabled.</p>

        <p>I liked many things about working at Yahoo.  I&rsquo;m coming to realize that what I (in hindsight) like <em>most</em> is probably the piece of software I thought about the <em>least</em> positively, namely Yahoo&rsquo;s mostly centralized and completely open bug tracking system: Bugzilla.  We abused it more than a bit, attempting to layer task and project management on top of a system that wasn&rsquo;t really designed to support it, but all told, Bugzilla made my work life better.</p>

        <p>Hopefully, you didn&rsquo;t notice a thing yesterday when I moved the site off my shared accelerator at Joyent, and onto a custom built slice at Slicehost.  That was very much the goal.  Briefly, I&rsquo;ll go through the steps I took to make the transition as smooth as possible both before the launch and directly afterwards.</p>
