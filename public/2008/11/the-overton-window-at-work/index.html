<meta http-equiv="description" content="The 'Overton window' is a bit of political jargon that describes how politicians influence the perceptions and debates that go on among the voting public.  In this thinly veiled (but mercifully short) rant, I argue that it's equally applicable to my workplace.">

  <p>This election &ldquo;year&rdquo; has gone on longer than I thought possible, and each time I pop open NetNewsWire to sift through my vaguely-political set of feeds, I&rsquo;m stunned that we&rsquo;re still disagreeing about some things, and equally stunned that we&rsquo;ve <em>begun</em> to disagree about other things as if they were reasonable topics of debate.  Obama as communist socialist fascist terrorist?  Really?  How did we get there?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window" title="Wikipedia: 'Overton Window'">Overton window</a> is an attempt to explain these shifts in political dialog.  Overton posited that there is a particular range of ideas deemed &ldquo;politically acceptable&rdquo; to the public at large.  Ideas outside this range are regarded as &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; or &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; and are therefore politically difficult to embrace successfully.  Further, Overton argues that it&rsquo;s actually possible to shift this window of acceptability in one direction or another by promoting ideas <em>even more</em> extreme than then &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; position you&rsquo;d really like to advocate.  By introducing a bold claim that&rsquo;s pinned way past the outer edge of public opinion (&ldquo;Obama is a Marxist.&rdquo;), you prime the electorial public to more readily accept your real position (&ldquo;Obama is <em>totally</em> too liberal.&rdquo;) as a very reasonable compromise and valid area of discussion.  Your fringe position is made palatable by the perception of an even more extreme view.  &ldquo;Obama&rsquo;s no terrorist, that&rsquo;s for sure!&rdquo;, the public will say, &ldquo;But I guess I <em>am</em> a little worried about his patriotism&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It struck me today that the Overton window is probably applicable beyond politics.  It can explain some things in the workplace as well.  In short, when you&rsquo;ve shifted your perception of the reasonable range of day-to-day &ldquo;normal&rdquo; far enough away from what really might <em>be</em> &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, normalcy starts to look pretty strange&hellip; pretty extreme.  And certainly far too difficult to attain, even if that normalcy <em>was</em> desirable.  Which it probably isn&rsquo;t.  I mean, &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;?  No reasonable person wants <em>that</em>!  That&rsquo;s a <em>fringe</em> idea, buddy.  </p>

<p>This is a long way of saying that my work is driving me more-than-usually insane at the moment.  Maybe I need to stop advocating my perceived normalcy, and start advocating <em>extreme</em> normalcy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll let you know how that goes.</p>
