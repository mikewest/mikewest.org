  <p>So, the disk on which I keep the main copy of my Aperture library started
making strange clicking noises when plugged into my powerbook.  It makes these
noises <em>instead of</em> the expected whirring and humming and actual <em>reading of
data</em>.  This, as you may suspect, is a Bad Thing.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it works perfectly when plugged into my work laptop, so I&rsquo;ve spent
the majority of the day descending into full-blown backup paranoia.  I&rsquo;ve
consolidated all my important and cloned them onto three separate hard drives.
Now I&rsquo;m beginning the process of burning a million DVDs.  Of course, the
aforementioned paranoia forces me to recognize that DVDs degrade; I can&rsquo;t
<em>trust</em> them, you see.  What to do?</p>

<p>This is thankfully a solved problem.</p>

<p>Usenet posters have used something called <a href="http://parchive.sourceforge.net/">Parchive</a> for years now to post
binary files with some guarantee of completeness in the intrinsically lossy
world of globally mirrored newsgroups.  Along with the actual data that&rsquo;s
written to a newsgroup, the poster will upload a number of <code>PAR</code> files
containing <em>parity information</em> that allows you to <em>regenerate</em> any lost data.
Without going into the details of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed-Solomon_error_correction" title="Wikipedia: 'Reed-Solomon error correction'">Reed-Solomon error correction</a>, this
means that if a few pieces of the data you&rsquo;re downloading are missing, you can
generate them yourself, ensuring that the original signal gets through.</p>

<p>The same theory applies to DVDs.  I don&rsquo;t particularly trust the medium to
<em>guarantee</em> successful backups over time, but I <em>do</em> trust that they&rsquo;ll
probably retain 99% of the bits I care about.  Parchive, therefore, looks like
a great solution.</p>

<h2 id="installing-parchive">Installing <code>parchive</code></h2>

<p>Installing Parchive is trivial.  You can grab binaries off sourceforge, or
check out the CVS tree and compile it yourself, like so:</p>

<pre><code>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@parchive.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/parchive login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@parchive.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/parchive co -P par2cmdline
cd par2-cmdline/
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<h2 id="using-parchive">Using <code>parchive</code></h2>

<p>The main thing I want to do with Parchive is create <code>PAR</code> files that contain
vital parity information about my data.  when doing so, there are two options
that are important to consider:  <strong>% redundancy</strong>, and <strong>block size</strong>.</p>

<p>The former option controls how much parity information is generated, that is,
how much data you can <em>lose</em> while still being able to regenerate the whole.
I&rsquo;ve settled on <strong>10%</strong> as being stupendously beyond the amount of bad sectors
I&rsquo;d expect to see on a DVD within a reasonable amount of time, and therefore
&ldquo;safe&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The latter option only makes sense if you know a little about how parchive
works: in a nutshell, it breaks your files up into smaller pieces, and
generates parity information for each block separately.  If you lose <em>one bit</em>
of a block, the whole thing is invalid, and has to be regenerated.  In an
ideal world, then, you&rsquo;d set the block size equal to the sector size of
whatever medium you&rsquo;re using for backup.  In that case, you&rsquo;ve got the best
protection against a single sector dying; you don&rsquo;t waste any space.  This
efficiency, however, is impractical for two reasons: first, the smaller the
block size, the longer it takes to process the data, and second, parchive&rsquo;s
algorithm is limited to a maximum of 32,768 (coincidentally, that&rsquo;s
2<sup>15</sup>) blocks.  If you set a 2k block size to <em>maximize</em> efficiency,
you&rsquo;d only be able to process ~65M before parchive fell over and died.  I need
to write parity information for up to a whole DVD&rsquo;s worth of data, ~4Gb
(~4.7Gb total capacity - 10% redundancy).  4 millionish kilobytes / 32768
blocks = about 123kb per block.  I&rsquo;ll double that (and round to the nearest
power of two, because I suspect that makes things easier internally), and
end up with a block size of 262,144 bytes.</p>

<p>So, creating <code>PAR</code> files for a directory is just a matter of plugging these
values into the <code>par2create</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>par2create -s262144 -r10 [NameOfParFile.par2] [FilesToRead]
</code></pre>

<p>Easy, eh?</p>

<p>Verifying the files in a directory is equally trivial, using <code>par2verify</code>:</p>

<pre><code>par2verify [NameOfParFile.par2]
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>par2verify</code> tells you that you&rsquo;ve got corruption in your data, you can
repair it with <code>par2repair</code>:</p>

<pre><code>par2repair [NameOfParFile.par2]
</code></pre>

<p>When that&rsquo;s finished, parchive will have magically regenerated your data from
the parity files you have at hand.  Brilliant.</p>
