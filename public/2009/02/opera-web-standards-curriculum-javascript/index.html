  <p>Last year, I jumped on the opportunity to sit down and write some articles for Opera&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/education/curriculum/" title="The Opera Web Standards Curriculum">Web Standards Curriculum</a>.  I bit off a bit more than I could chew, and Chris Mills exhibited the patience of a saint as I finished the first quickly, the second slowly, the third <em>very</em> slowly, and then completely failed to deal with the rest.  Regardless, those were released along with the rest of the JavaScript bits to complete the curriculum.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly proud of my end of the <em>process</em> of getting these articles released, but I&rsquo;m happy to see them released, and happier still to see the company they keep.  Chris did a brilliant job organizing a brilliant group of authors;  Opera (and Chris in particular) have organized a great body of work, which I&rsquo;m proud to have had a hand in.</p>

<p>My articles are: </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/javascript-functions/">JavaScript Functions</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/objects-in-javascript/">Objects in JavaScript</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/traversing-the-dom/">Traversing the DOM</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you enjoy them.</p>
