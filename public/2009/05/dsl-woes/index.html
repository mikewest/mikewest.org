  <p>My DSL connection is really quite fast; I&rsquo;m apparently only ~800m away from the nearest DSLAM, and so I should in theory be capable of maxing out the connection.  This holds up pretty well in speed tests: I get great downstream, and passable upstream scores when connecting to pretty much anything in Europe.  </p>

<p>All told, I should be thrilled with my service, but I&rsquo;m not, because it only seems to actually <em>work</em> about 80% of the time.  Every 10 minutes or so, my DSL modem gets confused about exactly what&rsquo;s going on and drops the connection, picking it up again about a minute later, and continuing on it&rsquo;s merry way with a new IP.  This wreaks havok with any sort of persistant-connection driven tool, be it SSH or IRC or Adium&hellip; drives me a bit nuts, actually.  It&rsquo;s gotten bad enough over the last few weeks that even Elisabeth notices the problem&hellip; :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been on the phone with <a href="http://www.hansenet.de/index.html">Alice</a> pretty regularly for a few weeks now, and it&rsquo;s the same every time: I call in, explain the problem to the first-line tech, who checks the logs, asks me what kind of modem I have, and passes me on to the second-line tech, who checks the logs, asks me what kind of modem I have, and runs a line test.  The line test is pretty much ok, but they pass it on to the third-line tech anyway.  The third-line tech does whatever it is that they do, and calls up a few hours later to tell me that they don&rsquo;t see any problem, but that they&rsquo;ll replace something anyway.  Last week it was the splitter.  The time before that it was something in-between my apartment and the DSLAM.  I&rsquo;m curious to see what it&rsquo;ll be this time.  Maybe the modem?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually not as frustrated about this as I could be.  The customer service has been more or less all that I could ask for (short of actually solving the problem, of course).  The reps are friendly, seem relatively knowledgeable, and don&rsquo;t treat me as though I&rsquo;m the problem.  I&rsquo;d love for them to actually track down the bugs and get them worked out so that I don&rsquo;t drop out of chat rooms every few minutes, but I&rsquo;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt so far.  This is a marked contrast to our previous dealings with <a href="http://www.t-online.de/">T-Online</a> and Telekom in general, with whom I now simply refuse to do business based on the absurdity of the customer experience.</p>

<p>In any event, they&rsquo;re working on my DSL again, and I&rsquo;m hoping the days of <code>mikewest_</code>, <code>mikewest__</code>, and <code>mikewest___</code> will soon be behind me.</p>
