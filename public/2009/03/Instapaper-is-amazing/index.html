  <p>I&rsquo;m subscribed to a slowly-expanding list of something like 230 RSS feeds (I
take the firehose approach to news-gathering, apparently), and for all
practical purposes, my internet experience centers around <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a>.
Most mornings, I sit down, skim through the headlines of some subset of my feeds,
and open tabs for all the the articles think I might find interesting.  Tabs
are NetNewsWire&rsquo;s killer feature, so far as I&rsquo;m concerned.  I can pop open a
few tabs and NNW happily keeps track of them across restarts so I don&rsquo;t miss
out on whatever it was that I found interesting if I don&rsquo;t read the article
immediately.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is sometimes as far as I get.  On Friday, I had 97 tabs
open; some had been sitting there since <em>January</em>, which is a bit absurd.
These were articles that I&rsquo;d almost certainly find interesting, but that I
hadn&rsquo;t made time to actually <em>read</em>.  Reading ought to be the entire point of
the tab-opening process, but here I was, opening tab after tab after tab,
regardless of the queue of content I&rsquo;d already identified.  Obviously
something has gone seriously wrong with my workflow.</p>

<p><a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/">Carlo</a> has been singing the praises of <a href="http://instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> for a while now, this
mountain of built up content seemed like a perfect test case.  After digging
around a bit, I came up with a script to &ldquo;integrate&rdquo; my Instapaper queue with
NNW (<a href="http://protagonist.co.uk/nnwInstaPost/">NNWInstaPost</a>), and I started pushing articles to Instapaper, and
closing tabs.  This worked halfway decently (I&rsquo;d like a &lsquo;to Instapaper&rsquo;
toolbar button in NNW.  Or a keyboard shortcut.  Or <em>anything</em> other than
clicking through the <code>Scripts</code> menu for each article individually).  After a
day or two, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that Carlo was right: Instapaper (in
particular, Instapaper.app on my iPhone) is <em>gobsmackingly brilliant</em>.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve <em>read</em> more articles with Instapaper in the last two days than I
have in the last two weeks with NNW alone.  Walking around with a queued-up
list of content in my pocket is really quite wonderful.  I can read on the
bus.  I can read while waiting for the bus.  I can read while walking from
the bus to the subway.  I can read on the subway.  Etc, etc.</p>

<p>I love it.  I think you will too, go <a href="http://instapaper.com/">try it out</a>.</p>
