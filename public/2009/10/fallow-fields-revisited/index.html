  <p>I&rsquo;m currently in the process of gutting my website, and rebuilding it piece by piece.  I suspect I&rsquo;m doing this to distract myself from the fact that I don&rsquo;t seem to have anything interesting floating around in my head to write about.  &ldquo;Surely it&rsquo;s the <em>site&rsquo;s</em> fault; raze it to the ground!&rdquo;, the large, simple, and shouty part of my brain tells me.  So I build anew (this is possibly <a href="http://mikewest.org/2009/09/productivity-or-my-lack-thereof">ironic</a>, but I&rsquo;m ignoring that).</p>

<p>Happily, the small, quiet, and generally reasonable portion of my brain agrees with the plan, at least insofar as it&rsquo;s clear that the current system (<a href="http://github.com/mikewest/fallow/">fallow</a>) was a solid idea but poorly implemented.  The system works, and I&rsquo;m happy I wrote it.  It was a good introduction to Ruby and Git, and a good reason to migrate off the almost-as-inefficient-as-wordpress Textpattern.  But it&rsquo;s failing me in a number of ways, the most important being that I literally forgot how to get content onto the site, and it took me 45 minutes of reading through painfully structured Ruby code to figure it out again.  That&rsquo;s the sort of thing that happens when you don&rsquo;t touch a website for 6 months.</p>

<p>Rather that catalog the failings of the system I&rsquo;m replacing (for they are legion), I&rsquo;d like to touch on the carefully considered bits I&rsquo;m keeping:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>URL structure: Posts live at <code>/[year]/[month]/[URLified Title]</code> which
seems more or less perfect to me.  It&rsquo;s meaningful, while containing just
enough temporal context to make completely outdated information easy to
spot.  Moreover, it provides a natural <code>/[year]/</code> and <code>/[year]/[month]/</code>
for yearly and monthly archive pages.  Tag pages live under <code>/tags/[tag]</code>,
which makes sense, and ad hoc pages have ad hoc URLs (<code>/is/</code>, for instance).
This strikes me as a clean setup, one which I can&rsquo;t see any way to improve 
upon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Content storage: The site&rsquo;s content consists entirely of UTF-8 encoded text
files on disk.  Text files are simple to work with, and have a more or less
infinite shelf life.  A site like this one simply doesn&rsquo;t need a database,
a single flat text file per piece of content is <a href="http://mnmlist.com/a-case-for-storing-all-your-info-in-text-files/">good enough</a>.  Metadata
(title, tags, etc.) is contained in a YAML block at the top of each file.
It&rsquo;s a format that is clear, human readable, and easily parsed, and I&rsquo;m
especially pleased to see that the format I&rsquo;d decided upon for Fallow
matches up quite well against more widely used systems like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Static HTML: Dynamic content doesn&rsquo;t really exist on this site.  I write an
article, then post it online.  That&rsquo;s the extent of the processing that
particular page needs.  The server shouldn&rsquo;t be working to rebuild an
article from last week (or last year!) every time it&rsquo;s requested, that&rsquo;s
simply wasteful.  This site, therefore, generates a page once when it&rsquo;s
created, or when a template changes, and then simply serves that cached copy
over and over again.  Similarly, overview pages (like tag pages, or current
archives) are regenerated when a new article is published, then served
straight from disk.  On a small VPS, I can serve upwards of 300 static 
requests per second through Nginx with extremely low load.  Textpattern
would fall over and die at those absurd traffic levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Historical redirects: The (miserable) <code>/blog/id/[ID]</code> URL structure I
decided upon in 2005 still works for the content I&rsquo;ve kept from that period.
The (also bad) <code>/archives/[Title]/</code> structure from 2007-8 works too.  The
(not so lovely) Tumblr-generated links for content that used to be at
<code>blog.mikewest.org</code> will redirect nicely.  All these old URLs will continue
to generate nice, clean permanent redirects
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">for the foreseeable future</a>: why make the reader jump through hoops
created by my lack of foresight?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, those are the good bits I&rsquo;d like to keep going as I rebuild.  With the understanding that I&rsquo;m about to make one of those dangerous &ldquo;forward looking statements&rdquo; that I never seem to follow through on as cleanly as I&rsquo;d like, I expect <code>mikewest.org</code> to be running a new Jekyll-based backend sometime in October.  With luck, no one will notice a thing but me.  With even more luck, I&rsquo;ll squeeze out a post or two about the bits of Jekyll I&rsquo;m adjusting, and the places where it&rsquo;s falling down completely.</p>
