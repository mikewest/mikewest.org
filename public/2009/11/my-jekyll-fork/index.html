  <p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is an interesting project, a well-architected throwback to a time before unnecessary dynamism reigned supreme.  In contrast to blog engines like Wordpress or Textile, Jekyll doesn&rsquo;t attempt to do anything other than push raw content through a few simple filters out into the world in the form of static HTML files.  Jekyll&rsquo;s <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">publication philosophy</a> is very much in line with my own, and I appreciate the work that&rsquo;s gone into it.  It&rsquo;s relatively widely used, and therefore much more stable and well-tested than anything I&rsquo;d write on my own.  Given my <a href="http://twitter.com/mikewest/status/4605321990">recent experience</a>, I want something that will Just Workâ„¢, and this looks like it.  I finished moving this site to Jekyll yesterday, and I&rsquo;m quite happy with how it&rsquo;s working&hellip;</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t fit me perfectly, though.  Here, I&rsquo;ll point to a few features that I think are missing, and a few design decisions that I think are worth reconsideration.  Happily, it&rsquo;s an open source project, so I&rsquo;ll also be able to point to my fork of the project where I&rsquo;m busy addressing these shortcomings.</p>

<h2 id="generated-pages-tags-and-archives">&ldquo;Generated&rdquo; Pages: Tags and Archives</h2>

<p>The biggest gap I see in Jekyll&rsquo;s feature set is support for &ldquo;generated&rdquo; pages (covered in <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues#issue/16">Issue #16</a>).  HTML that Jekyll produces is tied one-to-one with files you create on the filesystem.  This has the appeal of simplicity, fails in a number of ways to support two quasi-dynamic things that I consider essential to the kind of sites Jekyll aims to produce: tags, and archives.</p>

<p><strong>Tags</strong> are a nice way of grouping content on a site, and surfacing that content to readers in an unobtrusive way.  Jekyll, out of the box, does a miserable job of making them available in templates.  <code>site.tags</code> gives you a list of <em>all</em> the site&rsquo;s tags, <code>page.tags</code> gives you the tags for the current page, and that&rsquo;s it.  That&rsquo;s simply not enough structured data to do anything useful with; I want more.  &ldquo;More&rdquo;, in my case, meaning two things: a separate page for each tag at <code>/tags/[TAG]</code>, listing each article that fits; and a page listing out all the tags on the site (in cloud form, if only because I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> Web 2.0).  The latter is (painfully) possible out of the box, the former is not.</p>

<p>My solution (based heavily on <a href="http://matflores.com/">Matt Flores</a>&rsquo; <a href="http://github.com/matflores/jekyll/commit/abd0491c451b77bd119a0071457a362c35e6c2f6">fork</a>) is available in the <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/jekyll/tree/tag_index">tag_index branch</a> of my Jekyll fork.  The implementation is very low-impact: simply add a <code>tag_detail.html</code> layout to your site&rsquo;s <code>_layouts</code> directory.  Jekyll will auto-generate pages using that layout for each tag on your site, providing <code>page.tag</code> as a variable inside each as they&rsquo;re rendered.  This allows you to dive into <code>site.tags</code> to pull out lists of articles in a very straightforward way.  Once rendered into HTML, the result is placed into a directory you specify via a configuration variable (<code>tag_root</code>).  This has worked brilliantly for me here on this site.</p>

<p><strong>Archive pages</strong> listing out content written during a certain period are another nice way of dividing up posts on a site.  Especially useful for sites with more than a few posts, it&rsquo;s a mechanism for showing users posts that fit together temporally.  It&rsquo;s nice to be able to see <a href="/2007">all of 2007&rsquo;s posts</a>, for instance.  Or <a href="/2008/11">all posts from November of 2008</a>.  </p>

<p>Again, I borrowed a bit of code from Matt Flores, brought it up to date with the latest Jekyll tag (0.5.4 at the time I&rsquo;m writing this), and check it into the <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/jekyll/tree/archive">archive branch</a> of my fork.  Similarly to the tagging system above, archives depend on adding a few extra layouts.  <code>archive_yearly.html</code>, <code>archive_monthly.html</code>, and <code>archive_daily.html</code> are supported, and offer <code>page.year</code>, <code>page.month</code>, and <code>page.day</code>, which can be used to reference posts in <code>site.collated_posts</code>.  My <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/mikewest.org/blob/master/_layouts/archive_monthly.html"><code>archive_monthly.html</code></a> is indicative of how this can work.</p>

<p>Generated pages are written to <code>/[YEAR]/index.html</code>, <code>/[YEAR]/[MONTH]/index.html</code>, and <code>/[YEAR]/[MONTH]/[DAY]/index.html</code> if posts exist over the specified time period.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>Jekyll uses the <a href="http://www.liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> templating engine, which isn&rsquo;t exactly my first choice.  It&rsquo;s a solid engine, as far as it goes, but it&rsquo;s no <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/">Jinja2</a>.  Regardless, Jekyll has built in a number of useful filters that can be used to perform operations on text before it&rsquo;s rendered.  <code>textilize()</code> is a good example of this, running text through a Textile parser, then writing the output instead of the original text.  It&rsquo;s great!</p>

<p>Except, of course, for the fact that Textile is hideous.  :)  I much prefer to write Markdown formatted text (it&rsquo;s just easier for me to read, really), so I was a bit miffed when I discovered that a Markdown counterpart to <code>textilize()</code> was simply missing.</p>

<p>A more robust system is being discussed (slowly) in <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues#issue/19">Issue #19</a>.  I decided not to wait for a perfect solution, and simply added <code>markdownize()</code> in the <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/jekyll/tree/filters">filters branch</a> of my fork.  A trivial, but <em>very</em> necessary change. </p>

<h2 id="default-configuration-values">Default Configuration Values</h2>

<p>I really like the way that Jekyll expects posts to be formatted.  Each post lives in it&rsquo;s own file, and each file begins with a YAML block specifying metadata such as titles, teasers, and layout style.  This allows you to configure each post separately, and lends quite a bit of flexibility to the end product.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues#issue/19">Issue #25</a> points out, it&rsquo;d be nice if layout in particular could be specified at the site level as a default value.  Posts that need different layouts are (generally) few and far between, and a global configuration would make the most common case a bit simpler.</p>

<p>Henrik <a href="http://github.com/henrik/jekyll/commit/77bf31c42c25c2f87c215348a816b730104fe820">took a stab at a solution</a> to the problem, which I ran off with and improved upon in the <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/jekyll/tree/post_defaults">post_defaults branch</a> of my fork.  I&rsquo;m waiting on someone to take a look at this work now, but I&rsquo;m not holding my breath for it to be merged into the official release.</p>

<h2 id="problematic-design">Problematic Design</h2>

<p>Beyond gaps in the feature set, Jekyll does one or two things that I simply disagree with.</p>

<p>Jekyll tightly couples content and layout by assuming that both will exist together in a defined directory structure.  Leaving a bit of complexity to the side, a typical Jekyll site contains a <code>_posts</code> subdirectory filled to the brim with lovely raw content, and a <code>_layouts</code> directory filled with <a href="http://www.liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a>-based HTML templates.  The former is exclusively concerned with content, the latter exclusively with layout.</p>

<p>For the same reasons that we eventually started building websites without inline style information, separating the concerns of the site&rsquo;s semantics from it&rsquo;s layout and behavior, I don&rsquo;t believe that these bits belong in the same repository.  At a minimum, I&rsquo;d like to be able to deploy a version of my website&rsquo;s look and feel without worrying about whether or not I tagged the release before or after adding a post.  The one activity has nothing to do with the other, and both ought be able to proceed in parallel.  Jekyll&rsquo;s current implementation encourages mixing the two, which I don&rsquo;t appreciate.  Instead, I prefer to run two distinct repositories: one containing <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/mgc/">pure content</a>, the other containing <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/mikewest.org/">site-specific layout and configuration</a>.  This feels cleaner to me.</p>

<p>The solution I&rsquo;ve hacked together is available in the <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/jekyll/tree/contentpath">contentpath branch</a> of my Jekyll fork.  I&rsquo;ve added a single configuration variable (<code>content_root</code>) that contains an absolute path to the directory containing the site&rsquo;s content.  That directory will be parsed in it&rsquo;s entirety (e.g. no <code>_posts</code> subdirectory is required).  If a <code>_posts</code> directory exists in the usual location (<code>[SITE_ROOT]/_posts/</code>) it will be parsed as well to ensure backwards compatibility.  </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t expect this change to make it into the main tree, as it&rsquo;s probably not interesting for Jekyll&rsquo;s main audience of GitHub Pages users who <em>do</em> in fact very much want to deal with a single repository.  Moreover, when dealing with potentially malicious users, it&rsquo;s not a brilliant idea to give them the ability to generate publicly accessible pages from <em>any</em> readable directory on a system.  For my use, however, it&rsquo;s more or less perfect, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to keep it rebased on top of the latest Jekyll tags for anyone else who&rsquo;s of the same mind.</p>
