  <p>In a spontaneous burst of productivity, spawned mostly by my complete and utter failure as a sysadmin, I moved my parent&rsquo;s email account off my server, and onto Google&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.google.com/a/org/" title="Google Apps">Apps for your Domain</a> platform.</p>

<p>This finally gave me an excuse to move my DNS hosting to <a href="https://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/" title="DNS Made Easy">DNS Made Easy</a>.  The move turned out to be easier than I thought, and stunningly fast.  The dark times of multi-day propagation waiting-periods are (apparently) over: the whole process from account signup to complete and totally successful migration was about an hour.  I&rsquo;m thrilled.  This is the best hosting-related $15 I&rsquo;ve spent all year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve moved my parent&rsquo;s domain over, as well as <code>mikewest.org</code>.  While moving the latter, I had a little fun setting up &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/s0306/tuts/vanitydns.html" title="DNS Made Easy: Setting up your own Vanity DNS">Vanity DNS</a>.&rdquo;  I have <em>no</em> need for this feature whatsoever, and it&rsquo;ll probably cause me some pain in the future whenever the nameserver IP addresses change for whatever reason, but it satisfies my inner geek to see <code>ns0.mikewest.org</code> as the canonical name server for my domain:</p>

<p><img src="http://mikewest.org/images/5.png" /></p>

<p>So, two thumbs up for <a href="https://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/" title="DNS Made Easy">DNS Made Easy</a>.  They&rsquo;re absolutely living up to their name&rsquo;s promise.</p>

<h2 id="potentially-useful-technical-note">Potentially Useful Technical Note</h2>

<p>Relatedly, the <code>lookupd</code> command is gone in Leopard.  If you want to clear your DNS cache under 10.5, you need to use <code>dscacheutil</code>.  I&rsquo;ve added a quick alias to my <code>~/.bash_login</code> file, because I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m going to forget this in about 10 minutes.</p>

<pre><code>alias flushcache='sudo dscacheutil -flushcache';
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;d suggest you do the same, if you plan on mucking about with DNS settings, or editing your hosts file.</p>
