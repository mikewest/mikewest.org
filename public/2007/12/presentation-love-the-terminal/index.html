  <p>When Murray and Norm solicited talks earlier in the year for the Yahoo! Frontend Summit, they somehow neglected to mention that the presentations would end up being hour-long blocks.  :)</p>

<p>Regardless of the unexpected length, I really enjoyed giving this talk, and it was better attended than I expected.  There&rsquo;s a distinct stereotype of the command line as a dull wasteland, only suitable for hardened sysadmin types; I think that&rsquo;s absolutely wrong, as it&rsquo;s a critical part of my daily work.  I&rsquo;m glad I got a chance to share the basics, and happy to get some positive feedback about the presentation itself.</p>

<p>Since my talk wasn&rsquo;t recorded (I think mine was the <em>only</em> talk not to be recorded&hellip;  technical problems, or <em>sinister conspiracy</em>?!), I&rsquo;m in the process of writing it up in article form.  For now, I&rsquo;ve thrown the slides up on slideshare (which is wonderful, by the way (even if the embed markup is suboptimal)).  You can <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mikewest/love-the-terminal/" title="Mike West's 'Love The Terminal' on Slideshare">view it there</a>, or <a href="/file_download/12">download the PDF and some related bits directly</a>.</p>
