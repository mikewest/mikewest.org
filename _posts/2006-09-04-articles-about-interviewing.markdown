title: Articles about Interviewing

I'm currently boning up on interview lore in preparation for one I've got coming up in a few weeks (speaking of which, if you'll be in Munich on the 13th, drop me a line; First beer's on me!).  I'm ignoring the "big name" interview advice sites today (though [techinterview][] looks like a promising avenue for tomorrow...), instead using the magic of [NetNewsWire][] to dive back through my RSS feeds to find articles and essays that were written by people I read and respect.  A little research has yielded the following (very) short list of interview essays that I think are worth reading, whether you're prepping for an interview, or trying to figure out _how to_ interview: 

*   Steve Yegge has a number of excellent essays up, recounting his
    experiences interviewing candidates for software developer positions at
    Amazon.  The best of these is 
    "[Five Essential Phone Screen Questions][five_questions]", which outlines
    in great detail the critical areas to check for as early as possible in
    the interview process.  It's well written, and seems dead-on in terms of
    the areas it recommends.  
    
    He's also written "[Practical Magic][practical]", exploring the question
    of abstraction (which is directly applicable to the danger of
    over-reliance on frameworks and JavaScript libraries); 
    "[What You Need To Know][need2know]", espousing the virtues of
    interviewing for 'common sense'; and more recently 
    "[Interviewing Ruby Programmers][interviewing_ruby]" and it's followup
    "[The Truth About Interviewing][truth_interviewing]", arguing (among other
    things) that programming is _hard_, and that interviewees shouldn't be
    surprised or offended when companies' interview process sets a very high
    standard for acceptance.

    And really, [Steve's blog][steve] and his 
    [collection of older essays][rants] are well worth reading no matter what
    you're looking for, he's an entertaining and insightful guy.
    
    _[Edited 2006-09-28: Steve moved servers and didn't set up 301 redirects, so I updated the links manually.]_

*   Joel Spolsky (of [Joel on Software][joel_on_software] fame) has an essay
    up entitled "[The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing][joel]", which is both a
    great example of why I enjoy reading Joel's writing, but also a wonderful
    resource for technical interviews.  Though this essay is geared towards
    the _interviewer_, his advice and expectations are easily applicable to
    the _interviewee_.  He covers much of the same ground as Steve's essays, 
    though of course with his own spin, and offers some great tidbits about
    what he's looking for, and what he finds impressive.

    His essay "[Getting Your Résumé Read][resume]" looks like a keeper as
    well, though it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.
    
Do you know of any good articles I should add to the list?
