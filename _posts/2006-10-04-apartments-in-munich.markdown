So.  I'm looking for an apartment in Munich.  The "why" will have to wait a week or so to make sure everything's solid, but the apartment-looking cannot.

If you know of a cozy little one-bedroom apartment somewhere near the center of the city that's avaliable... well... _now_, I'd love it if you dropped me a line: <mike@mikewest.org>.  Likewise, if you have general advice about the city, I'd love to hear it.  Until then, I'll be digging through newspapers...

__UPDATE__: I did find a decent place for the short term.  I ended up looking through [Immobilien Scout 24][scout] (German) and visiting a few of the places listed there, but actually found my apartment in the [Classified Advertisements: Munich][ad] forums (English) at [Toy Town Germany][toy].  Check those out if you're in the market.
