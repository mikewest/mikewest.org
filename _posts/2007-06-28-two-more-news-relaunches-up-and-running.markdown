[Yahoo! Nachrichten][DE] in Germany and [Yahoo! Notizie][IT] in Italy are finally live.  It's been a bit of a struggle getting these sites launched, especially in the wake of Spain's super smooth run out the door.  Still, it's nice to have these sites out there; they're a huge improvement (if I do say so myself) over the old versions, much cleaner and easier for the producers to update, and standards based for all the right reasons (ignore the ampersands in the ad code, please...).

Four countries down... only France to go.  That'll happen soon, I believe.
