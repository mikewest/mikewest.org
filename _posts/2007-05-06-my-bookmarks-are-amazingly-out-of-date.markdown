Teaser: I'm removing the bookmarks from this site on a temporary basis.  That should
    drive me insane enough to actually do something about the fact that they haven't
    changed since last year.

title: My bookmarks are amazingly out of date.
---
The keen-eyed among you will have noticed that my bookmarks feed has been completely worthless since sometime around July of last year.  I simply stopped using [ma.gnolia][m], not because it's not a great service, but because August is when I started caring about [getting employed][y] and began, slowly, to abandon my website (and eventually everything else that wasn't directly related to my work... ah, that new job crunch).

I'm taking it off the site in an effort to force myself to do something else with the space.  Either I'll start using some sort of [social bookmarking site][d] again, or I'll interlace "quick links" in a Kottke-esque manner.  Either way, the big empty spot should drive me insane enough to do something about the problem this week.  Hopefully.  :)
