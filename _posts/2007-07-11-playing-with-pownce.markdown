title: Playing with Pownce&#8230;
---
[Carlo][] sent me a [Pownce][] invite today.  I think I played with [Twittr][] for about 10 minutes before giving up... Pownce looks a little nicer, and it's about time I try to figure out what's so exciting for the crazy kids these days (I'm apparently _old_ now, or at least out of touch... :) ).

If you're so inclined, [my Pownce profile][profile] is sitting around, waiting for people to find me.  And if you'd like an invite, I've got a very few remaining.
