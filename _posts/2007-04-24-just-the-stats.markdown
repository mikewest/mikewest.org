[A List Apart][ala] is currently running a [survey][] to gather statistical information about the web design/development community.  This certainly could be a cheap ploy to enhance their advertising through targeting a demographic or two, but I have great confidence in intentions of the people behind it.  Especially in the context of Jeffery Zeldman's article ["Women in web design: just the stats"][women], I have the feeling that this survey is a continuation of the fact-finding mission to which the "A(n) X Apart" venture has recently dedicated itself.

In that vein, I took the survey, and wrote a long comment about the extent to which women make up part of Yahoo! Germany's engineering team.  I'd suggest you do the same.  This could be a valuable tool to start digging into the demographics of our profession, and I hope they decide to make the data as available as possible for future research.

__Update__: The latest post on Zeldman's blog, ["The Web Design Survey"][survey] and [his comment on this post][comment], make the goals behind the survey crystal clear:

>   The information it collects will help us form a long overdue picture of
>   the ways web design is really practiced around the globe. The more people
>   who complete the survey, the richer and more detailed the picture will
>   become.  ...  After we close it, weâ€™ll slice and dice the data and present
>   our findings in a future issue of A List Apart.

It's not an advertising ploy, it's quite simply a gift to the community.  Let's take advantage of it.
