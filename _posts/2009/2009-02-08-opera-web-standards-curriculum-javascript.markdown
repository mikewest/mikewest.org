Teaser: Last year, I jumped on the opportunity to sit down and write some articles
    for Opera's Web Standards Curriculum.  I bit off a bit more than I could chew,
    and Chris Mills exhibited the patience of a saint as I finished the first quickly,
    the second slowly, the third _very_ slowly, and then completely failed to deal
    with the rest.  Regardless, those were released along with the rest of the JavaScript
    bits to complete the curriculum.

title: 'Opera Web Standards Curriculum: The JavaScript Bits'
---
Last year, I jumped on the opportunity to sit down and write some articles for Opera's [Web Standards Curriculum][wsc].  I bit off a bit more than I could chew, and Chris Mills exhibited the patience of a saint as I finished the first quickly, the second slowly, the third _very_ slowly, and then completely failed to deal with the rest.  Regardless, those were released along with the rest of the JavaScript bits to complete the curriculum.

I'm not particularly proud of my end of the _process_ of getting these articles released, but I'm happy to see them released, and happier still to see the company they keep.  Chris did a brilliant job organizing a brilliant group of authors;  Opera (and Chris in particular) have organized a great body of work, which I'm proud to have had a hand in.

My articles are: 

*   [JavaScript Functions][functions]
*   [Objects in JavaScript][objects]
*   [Traversing the DOM][dom]

I hope you enjoy them.
