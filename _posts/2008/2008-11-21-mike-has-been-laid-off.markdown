    new work.  If you've got leads for me, please [drop an email (mike@mikewest.org)](mailto:mike@mikewest.org)

Yahoo! has decided to close down the engineering team in it's German office, of which I am (er... [was][hmblo]) a part.  I'm suddenly _incredibly_ motivated to look for new work.

If you happen to know of an exciting web company somewhere in or around Munich that's in need of a solid webdev, please [drop me an email (mike@mikewest.org)][mail], [ping me on twitter][tweet], [take a look at my resume][resume] (or [linkedin profile][li], if that's your style), or give me a call ( +49 176 4854 6453 ).  I'd really _love_ to hear any and all leads you might have.  :)
