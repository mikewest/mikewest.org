title: Microformats on Kelkoo
---
[Ben Ward][ben] has a [great post up on YDN][ydn] discussing the massive
addition of [microformats][] to the latest refresh of the [Kelkoo][].  ~27
_million_ [hListings][hlisting] can't be wrong!  It's a great read, and a real
validation of the concept.

Moreover, it's an excellent introduction to __microformats as API__.  There's
no official Kelkoo API to grab and process listings or reviews or companies,
but the judicious use of microformats makes it _easy_ for you to grab and
parse the information out of the page on your own.  [The article's][ydn] very
much worth paging through; I suggest you [take a look][ydn].
