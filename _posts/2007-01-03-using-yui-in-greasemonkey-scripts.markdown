title: Using YUI in Greasemonkey Scripts
---
[Carlo Zottmann][carlo] has a [great article][article] on Yahoo's User Interface blog, outlining the mechanism he's come up with for loading elements of the [YUI library][yui] into his Greasemonkey scripts.  It's a powerful combination, and he's done some hard work to make the two play together in a fairly transparent manner.  With his code in hand, [using YUI in Greasemonkey user scripts] is simply a no-brainer.

[Carlo][] is a [bright][] and [entertaining][] guy, and he's rightfully proud of the contribution he's making to the community.  It's nice to have him sitting across the room when I have questions.  :)

And, honestly, I'll be beyond thrilled if I can _ever_ write an article in German with the apparent ease and elegance he's demonstrated in this piece.  Nice work, Carlo.
