I've just updated [`mcw_ma_gnolia`][project] to 0.4, tweaking the plugin to work with Ma.gnolia’s new linkroll JavaScript. This, of course, is a good reason to start working on something that actually uses the Ma.gnolia API instead of parsing through a linkroll JavaScript file. I’ll be starting on that soon.

[Download the new version][download] and let me know if you run into any problems.

[`mcw_ma_gnolia`][project] is a TextPattern plugin that generates a customizable Ma.gnolia link roll for use on your website.  If you're curious, visit [the project page][project] for all the details and documentation.
