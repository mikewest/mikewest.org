title: New Server, New Design

I've redesigned, and moved the website over to my new friends at [TextDrive][1], and it's now running on [TextPattern][2] instead of the homegrown CMS I was using on the old server.  This probably means that everything's going to show up again as unread in your feed reader...  Apologies for that.  

I've got nothing but free time at the moment, so I'm working on some articles which you should be seeing in the vaguely near future.  I'll keep you posted.
