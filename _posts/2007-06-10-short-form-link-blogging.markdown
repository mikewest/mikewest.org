Blogging is hard for me, mostly because I have an irrational desire to make
each of my posts _important_ and _interesting_.  In my head, these terms
somehow conflate into _long_, which puts up a pretty large barrier to actually
getting useful content onto the site.  I have a few half-completed (which is a
kinder way of saying "partially started") articles lying around my
[subversion repository][] that I simply haven't made time to finish, and I've
got a few more ideas skittering around my head that I haven't made time to
even sketch out yet.  I will eventually do the work to turn those into
passable articles (making time to write again is my New Year's Resolution,
after all... \*sigh\*), but for the moment, I've been looking for a quick way
to keep the site interesting during my creative downtime.  I think a
[Gruberesque][] linkfest is the answer.

Since I'm employed by [Yahoo][], I've begun using [del.icio.us][del] as a
dogfood experiment, and I've decided that I like it.  It's a _great_
bookmarking tool (especially in combination with the glorious [Pukka][]), but
I'm not sure it's suitable as a _blogging_ tool.  255 characters just aren't
enough, especially if I throw links into the mix.  I'm convinced of the 
creativity-enhancing powers of limitations, but the link-based, short-form
blogging tool I have in my head should be more "mini" and less "nano."

But, in the interests of doing _something_ until I get something more suitable
worked out, I'm redirecting my [bookmark RSS feed][del-rss] to del.icio.us.
Subscribe if you're interested.  :)
