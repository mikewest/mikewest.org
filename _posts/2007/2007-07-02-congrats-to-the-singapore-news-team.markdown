Congratulations to the Singapore news team for today's [successful relaunch][sg] of their news site!  They were able to take the code that the team here in Munich put together, modify it to meet their needs, and get the site launched on a very tight schedule.

[Alan][] and [Henry][], in particular, visited the Munich office for training sessions with myself (ha!) and the engineers here, then took off back home to share details with the rest of the team.  Nice job, guys.  Nice job indeed.
