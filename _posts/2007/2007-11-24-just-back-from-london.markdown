[@media Ajax][atmedia] was interesting.  I have more than "interesting" to say
about it, as you might expect, but I'm tired and lazy, and I'll get to a
fuller description of the high- and lowlights from my perspective sometime
tomorrow.  For now, I'll simply say that [Alex Russell][alex] is an _impressive_
speaker, and that the guys from [Ajaxian][] completely confirmed my opinion of the site (in short: they come at "Ajax" from an completely different world
than I do).

For the moment, I suggest that anyone with a vague interest in security read
Norm Hardy's ["The Confused Deputy"][deputy].  It's a brief article that
raised the idea of [capability-based security][capability], which is much more
relevant to your life than you might expect thanks to [cross-site request
forgery][csfr] attacks.  Afterward, if you're ready for more, read Dan
Bernstein's ["Some thoughts on security after ten years of qmail 1.0"][qmail],
which is an excellently practical discussion with an emphasis on trusted components that reminded me of the capabilities concept.

That should keep you busy while I jot down my various and sundry opinions of
@media, and figure out how much of this week's office drama I'm comfortable
writing publicly about.

Also: "@media" is a terrible conference name from a search-engine perspective. 
Can't we all just call it "atmedia ajax"?  Or "atmediaajax"?  Wouldn't that be
simpler for everyone?  :)
