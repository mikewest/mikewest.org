[Max Case][] dropped me an e-mail today, letting me know that the [SSHKeychain] repository [logged a commit][r96] for the first time in [almost a year][r95].  This update fixes a small bug that needed to be [worked around][workaround] to get a clean, stable, universal build of the application.  I've updated my [SSHKeychain universal build instructions][build] accordingly.

Moreover, [Bart Matthaei][] (SSHKeychain's author) has popped up [on the mailing list][mail] this month, and it looks like we'll be getting an "official" (beta) release sometime in the near future.  I use SSHKeychain on every machine I have, and my days would be much more tedious without it (do _you_ remember all your SSH passwords?).  I'm happy to see it's not succumbing to bit rot.  :)
