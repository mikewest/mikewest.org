title: Home again, home again&#8230;
---
I'm in Texas again for the first time in a year and a half...  Long flight yesterday, and I made the mistake of taking a "quick" nap shortly after arriving at my parents' house.  Now it's 4 in the morning, and I'm _wide_ awake.  :)

I'll be here for the next 2ish weeks.  Updates will be sporadic, e-mail response less so.  Until then...
