Teaser: I still haven't written anything useful about the @media Ajax conference,
    but here are some lovely pictures.  Should be worth about 64,000 words, right?

I said I'd write something about the @media Ajax conference, and I still plan to.  However, I've had other things on my mind the last day or two...  I work in interesting times.  Long story short, I'll get to it.

While you wait on whatever crazyness I eventually put to paper, enjoy [these @media Ajax photos][flickr] on Flickr.  I'm still learning how to use this camera...  and I'm discovering that my lens is quite a bit harder to focus at f1.4 than I thought...  But I'm getting there.  :)
