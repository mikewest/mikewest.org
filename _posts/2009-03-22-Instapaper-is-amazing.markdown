Teaser: I think I've _read_ more articles with Instapaper in the last two days than
    I have in the last two weeks with NNW alone.  It's an absolutely brilliant tool,
    and I'm excited about how much simpler it's made my internet-related reading life.

title: Instapaper is Amazing
---
I'm subscribed to a slowly-expanding list of something like 230 RSS feeds (I
take the firehose approach to news-gathering, apparently), and for all
practical purposes, my internet experience centers around [NetNewsWire][].
Most mornings, I sit down, skim through the headlines of some subset of my feeds,
and open tabs for all the the articles think I might find interesting.  Tabs
are NetNewsWire's killer feature, so far as I'm concerned.  I can pop open a
few tabs and NNW happily keeps track of them across restarts so I don't miss
out on whatever it was that I found interesting if I don't read the article
immediately.

Unfortunately, this is sometimes as far as I get.  On Friday, I had 97 tabs
open; some had been sitting there since _January_, which is a bit absurd.
These were articles that I'd almost certainly find interesting, but that I
hadn't made time to actually _read_.  Reading ought to be the entire point of
the tab-opening process, but here I was, opening tab after tab after tab,
regardless of the queue of content I'd already identified.  Obviously
something has gone seriously wrong with my workflow.

[Carlo][] has been singing the praises of [Instapaper][] for a while now, this
mountain of built up content seemed like a perfect test case.  After digging
around a bit, I came up with a script to "integrate" my Instapaper queue with
NNW ([NNWInstaPost][]), and I started pushing articles to Instapaper, and
closing tabs.  This worked halfway decently (I'd like a 'to Instapaper'
toolbar button in NNW.  Or a keyboard shortcut.  Or _anything_ other than
clicking through the `Scripts` menu for each article individually).  After a
day or two, I've come to the conclusion that Carlo was right: Instapaper (in
particular, Instapaper.app on my iPhone) is _gobsmackingly brilliant_.

I think I've _read_ more articles with Instapaper in the last two days than I
have in the last two weeks with NNW alone.  Walking around with a queued-up
list of content in my pocket is really quite wonderful.  I can read on the
bus.  I can read while waiting for the bus.  I can read while walking from
the bus to the subway.  I can read on the subway.  Etc, etc.

I love it.  I think you will too, go [try it out][Instapaper].
