title: TextMate bundle for TextPattern
---
[Marios][marios] has put together a [TextMate][textmate] language bundle for [Textpattern][textpattern] that provides a slew of nice features for building Textpattern templates.

You get nice syntax highlighting for all the Textpattern tags you might use in your templates, auto-completion, snippets, and some integration with my [`mcw_templates`][mcw_templates] plugin.  If you use TextMate and Textpattern, do yourself a favour and [download the language bundle][article] from Marios' website.  Play around with it a little, I think you'll find that it's a much nicer way to edit your templates than Textpattern's internal system.
