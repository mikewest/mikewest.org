    and nice.

I have purchased the largest phone ever.

My new-to-me [Treo 600][] showed up today, and it's huge.  And heavy.  But it's a
reasonable (and dirt-cheap) alternative to the [iPhone][iWant], especially
given that the latter isn't coming out in Europe for _months_...  It
probably has a battery that won't die after a day and a half like my
[current phone][j210i], and it's jam-packed with Palmy goodness.  I'll finally
be able to sync my address book with my cell phone and carry around _all_ my
numbers _ever_.  You've no idea how valuable that is until you, say, lock
yourself out of your apartment without your landlord's phone number.  Which I
absolutely didn't do yesterday.

That said: it's huge.  Did I mention that?  Makes me hope the iPhone really 
feels a bit sleeker...  I'm not even sure the Treo's going to fit in my
pockets (__Update__: It fit.  And the iPhone's almost half the thickness... so I'm still looking forward to it).
