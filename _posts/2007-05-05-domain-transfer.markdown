title: Domain Transfer

I'm in the process of transferring [mikewest.org][mwo] away from [GoDaddy][gd].  They're crazy-cheap, but I just feel a tiny bit dirty every time I visit the website.  I don't want to click through 3 tricky pages of upselling every time I touch a domain, I'm not particularly fond of the [guy running the place][bp], and the ads... oh the ads.

The registrar I'm testing out is [gandi.net][g].  I've read nothing but good things about their service, and they seem solid.  Moreover, they seem solidly on the side of the customer in domain ownership disputes.

So, if the website disappears for a bit, it's because something crazy happened in the world of domain registrars.  I don't expect that to happen, but you never know...
