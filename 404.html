    <h1>Oh noes, a 404 code is coming <em>right for us</em>!</h1>
    <p>You&rsquo;ve found a nonexistant page!  That&rsquo;s a sign of luck in many cultures, you know... Just not <em>this</em> one.  Too bad!  In an ideal world, I'd try to figure out what it is that you were expecting to find by intelligently parsing the URL for keywords and such, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to writing that code yet.  Sorry!</p><p>But hey! Since you&rsquo;re here, why not visit <a href="/">the homepage</a> to see what I&rsquo;ve been up to recently, or <a href="/archive/">the archive</a> for older articles and links?</p>
