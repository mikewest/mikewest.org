  <p>So, I got pretty clever with my <a href="http://mikewest.org/archive/leveraging-modrewrite" title="Leveraging `mod_rewrite`"><code>mod_rewrite</code> rules</a> to deal with some of the programs out there that nefarious types use to find vulnerable targets for exploits.  At least, I thought I was being clever.  As it turns out, I ended up shooting myself in the foot with the following rule:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}    ^(.*)main.php$  [NC]
RewriteRule ^(.*)           -               [F,L]
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s intention was to stop a bot from hammering me with requests for <code>main.php</code> in a wide variety of directories in the hopes that I had a broken version of <a href="http://www.horde.org/" title="Horde Project">Horde</a> installed.  These requests were generating tons of 404 (&ldquo;Not Found&rdquo;) errors, making my log files pretty much worthless.  Sending 403 (&ldquo;Forbidden&rdquo;) responses solved the immediate problem, but caused me some headaches yesterday when I tried to import a new project into <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" title="Subversion">Subversion</a>.  Specifically, I was getting the following error:</p>

<pre><code>svn: Commit failed (details follow):
subversion/libsvn_ra_dav/util.c:296: (apr_err=175002)
svn: PUT of '/svn/&lt;snipped long directory string&gt;/lang_main.php': 403 Forbidden (https://mikewest.org)
</code></pre>

<p>In context, this is obvious.  The file I was trying to import was triggering the <code>mod_rewrite</code> rule, generating a 403 response.  I simply forgot entirely that my <code>mod_rewrite</code> rules were a factor when running Subversion over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV" title="Wikipedia: WebDAV">WebDAV</a>.  Once the support staff at <a href="http://textdrive.com/" title="TextDrive">TextDrive</a> pointed out my oversight, fixing the problem was trivial.  </p>

<p>I added the following rule to the top of my <code>.htaccess</code> file&rsquo;s list of <code>mod_rewrite</code> rules:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}    ^/svn
RewriteRule    ^(.*)            -        [L]
</code></pre>

<p>That simply stops the engine from rewriting anything under my <code>/svn/</code> directory, which solved the problem completely.  One more thing to look out for&hellip;</p>
