  <p>If we were at a party together, you and I, I&rsquo;d be single-mindedly focused on finding the chance to casually drop some news into our conversation.  You&rsquo;d be impressed both by my announcement, but also by the coolness of my demeanor, as though I myself was unimpressed by this tidbit, as though opportunities like this one fell into my lap on a bi-weekly basis.  Your opinion of me would certainly improve.  Sadly, we&rsquo;re not at a party together, and I doubt that the fawningly ecstatic blog-post I&rsquo;m writing will convince you that I&rsquo;m not <em>terribly excited</em> about the fact that I&rsquo;m <a href="http://digital-web.com/news/2006/07/introducing_carolyn_wood_and_mike_west/" title="Digital Web Magazine's Blog: Introducing Carolyn Wood and Mike West">now</a> a part of <a href="http://digital-web.com/" title="Digital Web Magazine">Digital Web Magazine&rsquo;s</a> editorial team.</p>

<p>I doubt I need to inform you that <a href="http://digital-web.com/" title="Digital Web Magazine">Digital Web Magazine</a> is a brilliant repository of information for web professionals.  The consistent quality of the publication is impressive, and it&rsquo;s been a weekly read for me ever since I started getting serious about programming for the web.  I&rsquo;m delighted to begin assisting <a href="http://nickfinck.com/" title="Nick Finck: Digital Web's Publisher">Nick Finck</a>, <a href="http://www.kristastevens.com/" title="Krista Stevens: Digital Web's Editor-in-Chief">Krista Stevens</a>, and <a href="http://www.pixelingo.com/" title="Carolyn Wood: Digital Web's Managing Editor">Carolyn Wood</a> in the effort to seamlessly continue the production of a resource greater than the sum of it&rsquo;s parts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still learning the ropes, but there&rsquo;s a good deal more that I want to say on the subject over the next few weeks and months; the team&rsquo;s putting together a fantastic vision for the future of the magazine, and I&rsquo;ll eventually want to talk about how we&rsquo;re getting there.  It&rsquo;s inspiring to work with these folks, and I can assure you that we&rsquo;ll be doing our best to continue the publication of articles and interviews to keep <em>you</em> informed and inspired as well. </p>

<strike>While I'm on the subject, I should mention that we're still [looking for a Copy Chief][volunteer].  If you were correcting your kindergarten teacher's atrocious misuse of the semi-colon, and eat serial commas for breakfast, then we could use your help.  [Give us a buzz][volunteer], our mailbox is always open.</strike>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.techtorial.com/" title="Kerri Hicks: tech -- to' -- ri -- al">Kerri Hicks</a> has joined the Digital Web as our new Copy Chief, replacing the excellent <a href="http://www.textmodern.com/" title="Jennie Robinson: Text Modern">Jennie Robinson</a>.  The Chief is dead, all hail the Chief.</p>
