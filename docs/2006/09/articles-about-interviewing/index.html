  <p>I’m currently boning up on interview lore in preparation for one I’ve got coming up in a few weeks (speaking of which, if you’ll be in Munich on the 13th, drop me a line; First beer’s on me!).  I’m ignoring the “big name” interview advice sites today (though <a href="http://www.techinterview.org/" title="techInterview">techinterview</a> looks like a promising avenue for tomorrow…), instead using the magic of <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/" title="NetNewsWire: _The_ RSS Reader for OS X">NetNewsWire</a> to dive back through my RSS feeds to find articles and essays that were written by people I read and respect.  A little research has yielded the following (very) short list of interview essays that I think are worth reading, whether you’re prepping for an interview, or trying to figure out <em>how to</em> interview:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Steve Yegge has a number of excellent essays up, recounting his
experiences interviewing candidates for software developer positions at
Amazon.  The best of these is 
“<a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/five-essential-phone-screen-questions" title="Steve Yegge: 'Five Essential Phone Screen Questions'">Five Essential Phone Screen Questions</a>”, which outlines
in great detail the critical areas to check for as early as possible in
the interview process.  It’s well written, and seems dead-on in terms of
the areas it recommends.</p>

    <p>He’s also written “<a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/practical-magic" title="Steve Yegge: 'Practical Magic'">Practical Magic</a>”, exploring the question
of abstraction (which is directly applicable to the danger of
over-reliance on frameworks and JavaScript libraries); 
“<a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/what-you-need-to-know" title="Steve Yegge: 'What You Need To Know'">What You Need To Know</a>”, espousing the virtues of
interviewing for ‘common sense’; and more recently 
“<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2006/03/interviewing_ruby_programmers.html" title="Steve Yegge: 'Interviewing Ruby Programmers'">Interviewing Ruby Programmers</a>” and it’s followup
“<a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/truth-about-interviewing.html" title="Steve Yegge: 'Truth About Interviewing'">The Truth About Interviewing</a>”, arguing (among other
things) that programming is <em>hard</em>, and that interviewees shouldn’t be
surprised or offended when companies’ interview process sets a very high
standard for acceptance.</p>

    <p>And really, <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com" title="Steve Yegge: 'Stevey's Blog Rants'">Steve’s blog</a> and his 
<a href="http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/blog-rants" title="Stevey's Drunken Blog Rants">collection of older essays</a> are well worth reading no matter what
you’re looking for, he’s an entertaining and insightful guy.</p>

    <p><em>[Edited 2006-09-28: Steve moved servers and didn’t set up 301 redirects, so I updated the links manually.]</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Joel Spolsky (of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" title="Joel on Software">Joel on Software</a> fame) has an essay
up entitled “<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000073.html" title="Joel Spolsky: 'The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing'">The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing</a>”, which is both a
great example of why I enjoy reading Joel’s writing, but also a wonderful
resource for technical interviews.  Though this essay is geared towards
the <em>interviewer</em>, his advice and expectations are easily applicable to
the <em>interviewee</em>.  He covers much of the same ground as Steve’s essays, 
though of course with his own spin, and offers some great tidbits about
what he’s looking for, and what he finds impressive.</p>

    <p>His essay “<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ResumeRead.html" title="Joel Spolsky: 'Getting Your Résumé Read'">Getting Your Résumé Read</a>” looks like a keeper as
well, though it wasn’t exactly what I was looking for.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Do you know of any good articles I should add to the list?</p>
