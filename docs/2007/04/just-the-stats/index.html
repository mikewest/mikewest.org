  <p><a href="http://alistapart.com/" title="A List Apart Magazine">A List Apart</a> is currently running a <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2007/04/24/web-design-survey/" title="Jeffery Zeldman: The Web Design Survey">survey</a> to gather statistical information about the web design/development community.  This certainly could be a cheap ploy to enhance their advertising through targeting a demographic or two, but I have great confidence in intentions of the people behind it.  Especially in the context of Jeffery Zeldman&rsquo;s article <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2007/04/19/women-in-web-design/" title="Jeffery Zeldman: Women in webdesign - just the stats">&ldquo;Women in web design: just the stats&rdquo;</a>, I have the feeling that this survey is a continuation of the fact-finding mission to which the &ldquo;A(n) X Apart&rdquo; venture has recently dedicated itself.</p>

<p>In that vein, I took the survey, and wrote a long comment about the extent to which women make up part of Yahoo! Germany&rsquo;s engineering team.  I&rsquo;d suggest you do the same.  This could be a valuable tool to start digging into the demographics of our profession, and I hope they decide to make the data as available as possible for future research.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The latest post on Zeldman&rsquo;s blog, <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2007/04/24/web-design-survey/" title="Jeffery Zeldman: The Web Design Survey">&ldquo;The Web Design Survey&rdquo;</a> and <a href="http://mikewest.org/archive/just-the-stats#comment">his comment on this post</a>, make the goals behind the survey crystal clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The information it collects will help us form a long overdue picture of
  the ways web design is really practiced around the globe. The more people
  who complete the survey, the richer and more detailed the picture will
  become.  &hellip;  After we close it, weâ€™ll slice and dice the data and present
  our findings in a future issue of A List Apart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not an advertising ploy, it&rsquo;s quite simply a gift to the community.  Let&rsquo;s take advantage of it.</p>
