  <p>Blogging is hard for me, mostly because I have an irrational desire to make
each of my posts <em>important</em> and <em>interesting</em>.  In my head, these terms
somehow conflate into <em>long</em>, which puts up a pretty large barrier to actually
getting useful content onto the site.  I have a few half-completed (which is a
kinder way of saying “partially started”) articles lying around my
<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/revisioncontrol/" title="A List Apart: 'I Wonder What This Button Does'">subversion repository</a> that I simply haven’t made time to finish, and I’ve
got a few more ideas skittering around my head that I haven’t made time to
even sketch out yet.  I will eventually do the work to turn those into
passable articles (making time to write again is my New Year’s Resolution,
after all… *sigh*), but for the moment, I’ve been looking for a quick way
to keep the site interesting during my creative downtime.  I think a
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/">Gruberesque</a> linkfest is the answer.</p>

<p>Since I’m employed by <a href="http://de.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>, I’ve begun using <a href="http://del.icio.us/mikewest/">del.icio.us</a> as a
dogfood experiment, and I’ve decided that I like it.  It’s a <em>great</em>
bookmarking tool (especially in combination with the glorious <a href="http://codesorcery.net/pukka">Pukka</a>), but
I’m not sure it’s suitable as a <em>blogging</em> tool.  255 characters just aren’t
enough, especially if I throw links into the mix.  I’m convinced of the 
creativity-enhancing powers of limitations, but the link-based, short-form
blogging tool I have in my head should be more “mini” and less “nano.”</p>

<p>But, in the interests of doing <em>something</em> until I get something more suitable
worked out, I’m redirecting my <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/mikewest" title="Mike West's Links RSS Feed">bookmark RSS feed</a> to del.icio.us.
Subscribe if you’re interested.  :)</p>
