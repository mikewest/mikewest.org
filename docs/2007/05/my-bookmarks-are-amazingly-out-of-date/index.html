  <p>The keen-eyed among you will have noticed that my bookmarks feed has been completely worthless since sometime around July of last year.  I simply stopped using <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/" title="ma.gnolia">ma.gnolia</a>, not because it’s not a great service, but because August is when I started caring about <a href="http://de.yahoo.com/" title="Yahoo! Deutschland">getting employed</a> and began, slowly, to abandon my website (and eventually everything else that wasn’t directly related to my work… ah, that new job crunch).</p>

<p>I’m taking it off the site in an effort to force myself to do something else with the space.  Either I’ll start using some sort of <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="del.icio.us">social bookmarking site</a> again, or I’ll interlace “quick links” in a Kottke-esque manner.  Either way, the big empty spot should drive me insane enough to do something about the problem this week.  Hopefully.  :)</p>
