  <p><a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmediaajax/" title="@media Ajax">@media Ajax</a> was interesting.  I have more than “interesting” to say
about it, as you might expect, but I’m tired and lazy, and I’ll get to a
fuller description of the high- and lowlights from my perspective sometime
tomorrow.  For now, I’ll simply say that <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/" title="Alex Russell: Continuing Intermittent Incoherency">Alex Russell</a> is an <em>impressive</em>
speaker, and that the guys from <a href="http://www.ajaxian.com/">Ajaxian</a> completely confirmed my opinion of the site (in short: they come at “Ajax” from an completely different world
than I do).</p>

<p>For the moment, I suggest that anyone with a vague interest in security read
Norm Hardy’s <a href="http://cap-lore.com/CapTheory/ConfusedDeputy.html" title="Norm Hardy: The Confused Deputy">“The Confused Deputy”</a>.  It’s a brief article that
raised the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security" title="Wikipedia: Capability-based security">capability-based security</a>, which is much more
relevant to your life than you might expect thanks to <a href="http://shiflett.org/articles/cross-site-request-forgeries" title="Chris Shiftlett: Cross-Site Request Forgeries">cross-site request
forgery</a> attacks.  Afterward, if you’re ready for more, read Dan
Bernstein’s <a href="http://cr.yp.to/qmail/qmailsec-20071101.pdf" title="Dan Bernstein: Some thoughts on security after ten years of qmail 1.0">“Some thoughts on security after ten years of qmail 1.0”</a>,
which is an excellently practical discussion with an emphasis on trusted components that reminded me of the capabilities concept.</p>

<p>That should keep you busy while I jot down my various and sundry opinions of
@media, and figure out how much of this week’s office drama I’m comfortable
writing publicly about.</p>

<p>Also: “@media” is a terrible conference name from a search-engine perspective. 
Can’t we all just call it “atmedia ajax”?  Or “atmediaajax”?  Wouldn’t that be
simpler for everyone?  :)</p>
