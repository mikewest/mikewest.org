  <p>Hello, Internet&hellip;  It&rsquo;s been a while.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hopping a plane to London tomorrow to get into town in time for <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/" title="@media Ajax">@media Ajax</a> on Monday (which, by the way, has a <em>truly</em> stunning lineup.  You totally should have bought tickets before they sold out).  I haven&rsquo;t been to a proper conference since <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/" title="South by Southwest Interactive Conference in 2005">SxSW in 2005</a>, which was a prelude to the most productive period of my professional life.  Here&rsquo;s hoping that the conference atmosphere and rarified London air gives me the kick in the ass I&rsquo;m looking for to get out of the rut I think I&rsquo;ve fallen into.</p>

<p>The conference is Monday and Tuesday.  I&rsquo;l be working from the London office the rest of the week, which should be entertaining, if nothing else.  I&rsquo;ve got a whole list of people there I need to chat with for one reason or another, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to making the rounds in person instead of via IM.  </p>

<p>In any event, it should be a good week.  </p>
