  <p>Last Thursday, I had the opportunity to chat with folks in the CMS community about some client-side
web security topics that I find pretty relevant today. Preparing the talk was a bit of a strange
experience; I think I could have directly copied most of the slides from similar presentations I’ve
given years ago, and it’s a little frustrating that they’re <em>still</em> so relevant. That said, this was
a good opportunity to discuss some new bits and pieces that are only now coming into focus after a
lot of design work and discussion.</p>

<p>I aimed to get a few messages across:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>My team is focused on two sets of web platform attacks: <strong>script injection</strong> continues to be
both high risk and pervasive, and we’re rapidly discovering the side-channeled consequences of
insufficient isolation. These are topics I’d love web developers to be paying attention to as
well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Injection attacks can be reasonably mitigated today with a reasonably
<a href="https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/strict-csp.html">strict Content Security Policy</a>, and I’m hopeful about our ability to more robustly
address the underlying vulnerability via new tools like <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/trusted-types">Trusted Types</a>. I would love
to see web developers deploy the former, and start playing around with the latter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Browsers and developers can cooperate to attenuate side-channel attacks by shifting away from
the web’s embed-everything defaults, moving instead towards an opt-in model that more tightly
constrains attackers’ ability to unexpectedly poke at resources. Chrome will be shipping
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy</code> shortly, and we intend to ensure
that they’re in place before enabling some APIs that risk aggravating side-channel attacks. To
make this work at scale, it’s critical that we collectively help developers place priority on
applying <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy</code> assertions to intentionally-embeddable resources.</p>

    <p><em>Note that Artur Janc, et al. have put together a great <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDlfvfTJ_9e8Jdc8ehuV4zMEu9ySMCiTGMS9y0GU92k/edit">explainer for Cross-Origin
Resource/Embedder/Opener Policy</a> that I’m kicking myself for not linking in the
talk. So. I’m linking it here, now.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I pointed folks to <a href="https://github.com/mikewest/securer-contexts">Securer Contexts</a> as an area where I think browsers can
revisit the minimum bar for modern applications that we set back in ~2015. Transport security
seems quite insufficient to mitigate today’s threats, and nudging developers more firmly towards
the tools noted above seems imminently reasonable to me.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I’d appreciate feedback on these priorities, and also on the particular mitigations proposed above.
I’m hopeful that they’re generally-applicable and widely-deployable, and would love to hear how
y’all see things.</p>

<p>For completeness, I’ll embed the slides below (but I think you’ll only get as much out of them as
you’ve already gotten out of the bullets above). For those of you that were in the room, thanks for
listening!</p>
