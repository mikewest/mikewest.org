  <p>Pagination is a basic building block of the web, appearing practically everywhere content is displayed.  From a UI perspective, a pagination widget generally ends up being presented in a very straightforward manner as a horizontal list of links, framed by “previous” and “next” links to give the user clear calls to action.  Flickr and CNN provide good examples of this general pattern:</p>

<p><img src="/static_content/2010-02-pagination-pattern.png" alt="Pagination widgets on Flickr and CNN" /></p>

<p>Flickr marks this up as a flat series of <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> tags inside a <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code>, CNN as a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ul</code>, containing one <code class="highlighter-rouge">li</code> for each page.  And those certainly aren’t the only options: while doing a bit of research for a project at work, I came across a much wider than expected variety of markup, and no clear “best practice.”</p>

<p>After thinking about it a bit, and grilling my more intelligent friends, I’ve settled on a pattern that I think works pretty well.  It’s nothing at all groundbreaking, but is certainly worth documenting as a markup pattern I’d advocate.  The HTML is straightforward (and an <a href="/static_content/2010-02-pagination-pattern.html">example</a> is available):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;p id="paginglabel" class="audible"&gt;Pagination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul role="navigation" aria-labelledby="paginglabel"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;span class="audible"&gt;%TYPE% Page&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#" rel="prev"&gt;&lt;span class="prev"&gt;Previous&lt;span class="audible"&gt;: %TYPE% Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="audible"&gt;You're currently reading %TYPE% page &lt;/span&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#" rel="next"&gt;&lt;span class="next"&gt;Next&lt;span class="audible"&gt;: %TYPE% Page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;span class="audible"&gt;%TYPE% Page &lt;/span&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I see a few advantages to this markup:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Clear signposting</strong></p>

    <p>The widget uses the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-wai-aria-20091215/states_and_properties#aria-labelledby"><code class="highlighter-rouge">aria-labelledby</code> attribute</a> to instruct
capable browsers to use the contents of the preceding paragraph as a
label, and the <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/?p=106"><code class="highlighter-rouge">role</code> attribute</a> to demarcate the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ul</code> as a
navigation landmark on the page.</p>

    <p>These are especially important for visitors making use of screenreaders or 
other assistive technologies, as they typically have the option of 
navigating through a page’s content by jumping directly from one list to 
the next, or from one landmark to the next.  In such a scenario, the label 
and role will be announced before reading the contents of the list, 
providing essential information about its context and purpose which would 
otherwise be lacking.</p>

    <p>Likewise, the previous and next pages are given <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.1.2"><code class="highlighter-rouge">rel</code> attributes</a>,
making their relationship to the current page crystal clear, and available 
to any capable parser.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Clear link text</strong></p>

    <p>A link containing only the text “1” is more or less useless to a visitor
who can’t visually link the text to it’s context.  Adding that context is
simply done, however, by placing some additional text inside the link.  An 
addition as trivial as “Page 1” makes a huge difference in comprehension.
This text can be hidden for sighted users by wrapping it in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">span</code>, and
<a href="http://accessibilitytips.com/2008/03/05/avoiding-visibility-hidden/">positioning it offscreen</a> via CSS.  The current page is called 
out in the same way, providing the visitor with additional context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deduplication</strong></p>

    <p>CNN and Flickr made the same choice when marking up the widget’s “Previous”
and “Next” links.  Even though these both link off to items which are also
available in the list, the link has been duplicated, breaking the
relationship between the visible page number, and the textual label.  I’d
argue that it’s better to group the two into the same <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> element, using one
link for both elements.</p>

    <p>The markup above does just that, placing the textual labels inside the link
element itself, making it clear that the previous page is page 2.  The
presentation of the “previous” and “next” links to the left and right of
the list, respectively, can be handled by positioning their containing
<code class="highlighter-rouge">span</code>s absolutely.  This requires approximate knowledge of the text’s
size, and can usually be accommodated even in multi-language environments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sound over Semantics</strong></p>

    <p>For pagination, it seems like it would make perfect sense to use an ordered
list rather than the unordered list I’ve chosen here.  It’s almost
certainly semantically correct, as the list of pages is indeed ordered, and
that order is indeed meaningful.</p>

    <p>In this case, however, I think it’s the wrong choice.  <a href="http://www.nvda-project.org/">NVDA</a> (which is
the only screen reader I have access to at the moment) reads ordered lists
as “One.  [List item content]  Two.  [List item content] …”  An unordered
list, on the other hand, doesn’t number the items as they’re read. Since I’m
explicitly including the page number in the link, an <code class="highlighter-rouge">ol</code> simply sounds
strange and repetitive: “One.  Example Page one. Link.  Two. Example page
two. Link. …”  Assuming other readers like <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/jaws-product-page.asp">Jaws</a> and <a href="http://www.gwmicro.com/Window-Eyes/">WindowEyes</a>
behave similarly, an unordered list simply <em>sounds</em> better.</p>

    <p><em>(Thanks to <a href="http://morethanseven.net/">Gareth</a> for the good <a href="http://twitter.com/garethr/status/9292593418">question</a> that I’d neglected to
address.)</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve put together a <a href="/static_content/2010-02-pagination-pattern.html">quick example of this markup at work</a>.  I hope you
reach for it next time you need a pagination widget.</p>
