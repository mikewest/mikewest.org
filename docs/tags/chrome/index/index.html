      platform marginally less insecure than it generally is. Drop him an

        <p>When you start Chrome, it attempts to connect to three random domains. I’ve seen a few theories about why exactly this happens that brush up against the nefarious. The true rationale is incredibly mundane: hopefully this short summary will clear things up.</p>

        <p>Based on the Content Security Policy primer I wrote last week, you should have a good idea of what CSP can offer a website developer. What might not be clear is that the policies can extend beyond HTTP, a bit more deeply into the browser. Chrome offers Content Security Policy support for extensions that substantially reduce the possibility of permission leakage; this article describes how it works, and how you can use it in your extensions.</p>

        <p>With a simple Wi-Fi packet-sniffer, intercepting login cookies over the air is far easier than it ought to be. Happily, clever people have put together solid mitigation techniques, one of which is HTTP Strict Transport Security. I’ve implemented it on a personal site, this article describes what it is, why it’s important, and how you can use it yourself.</p>

        <p>Dave Winer ends an otherwise quite reasonable piece about his concern at Facebook’s “frictionless sharing” with a non sequitur attack on Chrome for, as far as I can tell, nothing it’s actually doing.</p>

        <p>I sat down with Technikwürze’s Marcel Böttcher way back at the beginning of February to talk about the exciting new release of Chrome 9 to the stable channel, and a few other bits and pieces of the Chrome ecosystem. That interview (in German) is just now seeing the light of day as Technikwürze 178.  After listening to it last night, I think it generally went pretty well, modulo a few small mistakes on my part.</p>

        <p>Yesterday at the Silicon Valley GTUG meetup, I gave a presentation introducing the IndexedDB API.  I’ve thrown the slides on Slideshare, but the transcription there is absolutely miserable.  I’ll reproduce it here in a readable format, and add a few notes where appropriate.</p>
