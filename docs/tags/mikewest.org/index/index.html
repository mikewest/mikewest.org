        <p>Jekyll is a well-architected throwback to a time before Wordpress, when men were men, and HTML was static.  I like the ideas it espouses, and have made a few improvements to it’s core.  Here, I’ll point out some highlights of my fork in the hopes that they see usage beyond this site.</p>

        <p>I’m currently in the process of gutting my website, and rebuilding it piece by piece.  I suspect I’m doing this to distract myself from the fact that I don’t seem to have anything interesting floating around my head to write about. Rather that catalog the failings of the system I’m replacing (for they are legion), in this article I’d like to touch on the carefully considered bits I’m keeping around.</p>

        <p>I think I’ve <em>read</em> more articles with Instapaper in the last two days than I have in the last two weeks with NNW alone.  It’s an absolutely brilliant tool, and I’m excited about how much simpler it’s made my internet-related reading life.</p>

        <p>Last year, I jumped on the opportunity to sit down and write some articles for Opera’s Web Standards Curriculum.  I bit off a bit more than I could chew, and Chris Mills exhibited the patience of a saint as I finished the first quickly, the second slowly, the third <em>very</em> slowly, and then completely failed to deal with the rest.  Regardless, those were released along with the rest of the JavaScript bits to complete the curriculum.</p>

        <p>I liked many things about working at Yahoo.  I’m coming to realize that what I (in hindsight) like <em>most</em> is probably the piece of software I thought about the <em>least</em> positively, namely Yahoo’s mostly centralized and completely open bug tracking system: Bugzilla.  We abused it more than a bit, attempting to layer task and project management on top of a system that wasn’t really designed to support it, but all told, Bugzilla made my work life better.</p>

        <p>Yesterday, Yahoo! made some announcements regarding The Future™ of many of their high profile properties.  Specifically, they’re (slowly) opening up, enabling third-party developers to build applications that can be seen on and interact with your My Yahoo! page, or your mailbox.  I think this is a great step, and one I wish they’d made <em>before</em> they laid me off.</p>

        <p>Over the last two or three weeks, a substantial subset of my friends and colleagues have started using GitHub to host some of their personal projects.  I’m really enjoying this influx, and it’s inspiring in a way I didn’t really expect.  GitHub has done nothing less than to make my friend’s coding activity <em>visible</em> to me, and mine visible to them.  This doesn’t sound like much, but it’s simply transformative; If this is how “normal” people feel about Facebook, then I can start to understand how it’s captured so much mindshare.</p>

        <p>On the bus home from work, I was listening to this week’s On the Media. In particular, I was struck by a great interview with the man who designed the field-organizer and volunteer training programs for Barack Obama’s campaign: Marshall Ganz.  If you’re at all interested in the political angle, I’d suggest you listen.  If you’re at all interested in how I’m planning to apply this seemingly unrelated topic to the technical field of web development (et al), keep reading.</p>

        <p>I’m trying to do something with the Flickr API that I consider to be relatively trivial. I have the impression that the API is fighting me every step of the way. Why, oh why, can’t the wonderful people who designed Del.icio.us’s new API hop over to Flickr and slap together something that makes sense from the perspective of the end user?</p>

        <p>Nginx is a brilliant little HTTP server that I’m using on this website to quickly serve static content.  It bothers me a (very) little that it doesn’t correctly generate Etag headers for static content, however.  I’m attempting to remedy that oversight by releasing an Nginx module: <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx-static-etags</code>.</p>

        <p>Hopefully, you didn’t notice a thing yesterday when I moved the site off my shared accelerator at Joyent, and onto a custom built slice at Slicehost.  That was very much the goal.  Briefly, I’ll go through the steps I took to make the transition as smooth as possible both before the launch and directly afterwards.</p>

        <p>It’s been quite some time since I put any serious effort into mikewest.org.  I’ve had tons of work, I’ve been burnt out, I’ve been complacent… the excuses pile on top of each other, each valid, each sufficient, none satisfactory.  For the sake of my own sanity, I need to start working on personal projects again.  Last week’s GitHub dump was the first step in that direction.  Consider this relaunch to be the second.</p>
