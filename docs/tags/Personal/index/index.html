        <p>Recently, I wrote a short article on the effect a team’s sense of ownership in it’s projects can have on the finished product.  The surprising twist in my professional life last week has led me back onto the same train of thought, but I’m coming to it from a slightly different angle.</p>

        <p>Yahoo! decided to stop doing development work in it’s German offices, which leaves me in a bit of a bind.  I’m suddenly <em>incredibly</em> motivated to look for new work.  If you’ve got leads for me, please <a href="mailto:mike@mikewest.org">drop an email (mike@mikewest.org)</a></p>

        <p>Details are everything, but worrying about details at the expense of progress puts the cart before the horse, misses the forest for the trees, makes perfect the enemy of the good, and can be described by many other metaphors with similar meaning.</p>

        <p>On the bus home from work, I was listening to this week’s On the Media. In particular, I was struck by a great interview with the man who designed the field-organizer and volunteer training programs for Barack Obama’s campaign: Marshall Ganz.  If you’re at all interested in the political angle, I’d suggest you listen.  If you’re at all interested in how I’m planning to apply this seemingly unrelated topic to the technical field of web development (et al), keep reading.</p>

        <p>It’s been quite some time since I put any serious effort into mikewest.org.  I’ve had tons of work, I’ve been burnt out, I’ve been complacent… the excuses pile on top of each other, each valid, each sufficient, none satisfactory.  For the sake of my own sanity, I need to start working on personal projects again.  Last week’s GitHub dump was the first step in that direction.  Consider this relaunch to be the second.</p>
