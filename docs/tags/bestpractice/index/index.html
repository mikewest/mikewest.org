        <p>One question you’re almost certainly not asking yourself is “What’s Mike West been up to?”  That’s a shame, really, as I’ve got some projects floating around that I’m proud of, and that I’d like to share with you. Moreover, I’d like to point out the project documentation pages that I’ve put together as a meta-project; I think it’s worth your time to take a look.</p>

        <p>One of the few tools that I consider truly indispensable when developing websites is JSLint.  Too bad it’s almost impossible to contribute back to the project, and that the project’s run by someone who “will hurt your feelings.”</p>

        <p>Progressive enhancement of our sites and applications has become a relatively well accepted best practice for web development.  This article outlines a technique I’ve used successfully to ensure that core functionality is available without JavaScript, while maintaining a quality experience for the majority of users with JavaScript enabled.</p>

        <p>I liked many things about working at Yahoo.  I’m coming to realize that what I (in hindsight) like <em>most</em> is probably the piece of software I thought about the <em>least</em> positively, namely Yahoo’s mostly centralized and completely open bug tracking system: Bugzilla.  We abused it more than a bit, attempting to layer task and project management on top of a system that wasn’t really designed to support it, but all told, Bugzilla made my work life better.</p>

        <p>Hopefully, you didn’t notice a thing yesterday when I moved the site off my shared accelerator at Joyent, and onto a custom built slice at Slicehost.  That was very much the goal.  Briefly, I’ll go through the steps I took to make the transition as smooth as possible both before the launch and directly afterwards.</p>
