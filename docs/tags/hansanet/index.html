        <p>My DSL connection is really quite fast; I’m apparently only ~800m away from the nearest DSLAM, and so I should in theory be capable of maxing out the connection.  This holds up pretty well in speed tests: I get great downstream, and passable upstream scores when connecting to pretty much anything in Europe.  All told, I should be thrilled with my service, but I’m not, because it only seems to actually <em>work</em> about 80% of the time.</p>
