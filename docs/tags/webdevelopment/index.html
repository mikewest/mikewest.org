        <p>One question you’re almost certainly not asking yourself is “What’s Mike West been up to?”  That’s a shame, really, as I’ve got some projects floating around that I’m proud of, and that I’d like to share with you. Moreover, I’d like to point out the project documentation pages that I’ve put together as a meta-project; I think it’s worth your time to take a look.</p>

        <p>Progressive enhancement of our sites and applications has become a relatively well accepted best practice for web development.
