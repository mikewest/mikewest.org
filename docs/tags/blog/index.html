        <p>Jekyll is a well-architected throwback to a time before Wordpress, when men were men, and HTML was static.  I like the ideas it espouses, and have made a few improvements to it’s core.  Here, I’ll point out some highlights of my fork in the hopes that they see usage beyond this site.</p>

        <p>I’m currently in the process of gutting my website, and rebuilding it piece by piece.  I suspect I’m doing this to distract myself from the fact that I don’t seem to have anything interesting floating around my head to write about. Rather that catalog the failings of the system I’m replacing (for they are legion), in this article I’d like to touch on the carefully considered bits I’m keeping around.</p>
