        <p>Git makes it incredibly easy to work on a lot of a project’s features at once, hopping quickly back and forth between branches. I love this ability, but I hate remembering what exactly it was that I was working on in a particular branch. I know it had something to do with a particular bug, but I’ve no idea anymore which files I was fiddling around with to fix it. Here’s my solution to that problem.</p>

        <p>Yesterday at the Silicon Valley GTUG meetup, I gave a presentation introducing the IndexedDB API.  I’ve thrown the slides on Slideshare, but the transcription there is absolutely miserable.  I’ll reproduce it here in a readable format, and add a few notes where appropriate.</p>

        <p>So.  W3C has quite decent installation instructions for the HTML validator, but it makes a few assumptions about a typical linux environment that don’t actually hold true if you’re running a stripped down JeOS distro in a virtual machine.</p>

        <p>On the bus home from work, I was listening to this week’s On the Media. In particular, I was struck by a great interview with the man who designed the field-organizer and volunteer training programs for Barack Obama’s campaign: Marshall Ganz.  If you’re at all interested in the political angle, I’d suggest you listen.  If you’re at all interested in how I’m planning to apply this seemingly unrelated topic to the technical field of web development (et al), keep reading.</p>

        <p>I’m trying to do something with the Flickr API that I consider to be relatively trivial. I have the impression that the API is fighting me every step of the way. Why, oh why, can’t the wonderful people who designed Del.icio.us’s new API hop over to Flickr and slap together something that makes sense from the perspective of the end user?</p>

        <p>Nginx is a brilliant little HTTP server that I’m using on this website to quickly serve static content.  It bothers me a (very) little that it doesn’t correctly generate Etag headers for static content, however.  I’m attempting to remedy that oversight by releasing an Nginx module: <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx-static-etags</code>.</p>

        <p>Hopefully, you didn’t notice a thing yesterday when I moved the site off my shared accelerator at Joyent, and onto a custom built slice at Slicehost.  That was very much the goal.  Briefly, I’ll go through the steps I took to make the transition as smooth as possible both before the launch and directly afterwards.</p>

        <p>It’s been quite some time since I put any serious effort into mikewest.org.  I’ve had tons of work, I’ve been burnt out, I’ve been complacent… the excuses pile on top of each other, each valid, each sufficient, none satisfactory.  For the sake of my own sanity, I need to start working on personal projects again.  Last week’s GitHub dump was the first step in that direction.  Consider this relaunch to be the second.</p>
