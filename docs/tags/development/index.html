        <p>Git makes it incredibly easy to work on a lot of a project&rsquo;s features at once, hopping quickly back and forth between branches. I love this ability, but I hate remembering what exactly it was that I was working on in a particular branch. I know it had something to do with a particular bug, but I&rsquo;ve no idea anymore which files I was fiddling around with to fix it. Here&rsquo;s my solution to that problem.</p>

        <p>Yesterday at the Silicon Valley GTUG meetup, I gave a presentation introducing the IndexedDB API.  I&rsquo;ve thrown the slides on Slideshare, but the transcription there is absolutely miserable.  I&rsquo;ll reproduce it here in a readable format, and add a few notes where appropriate.</p>

        <p>So.  W3C has quite decent installation instructions for the HTML validator, but it makes a few assumptions about a typical linux environment that don&rsquo;t actually hold true if you&rsquo;re running a stripped down JeOS distro in a virtual machine.</p>

        <p>On the bus home from work, I was listening to this week&rsquo;s On the Media. In particular, I was struck by a great interview with the man who designed the field-organizer and volunteer training programs for Barack Obama&rsquo;s campaign: Marshall Ganz.  If you&rsquo;re at all interested in the political angle, I&rsquo;d suggest you listen.  If you&rsquo;re at all interested in how I&rsquo;m planning to apply this seemingly unrelated topic to the technical field of web development (et al), keep reading.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m trying to do something with the Flickr API that I consider to be relatively trivial. I have the impression that the API is fighting me every step of the way. Why, oh why, can&rsquo;t the wonderful people who designed Del.icio.us&rsquo;s new API hop over to Flickr and slap together something that makes sense from the perspective of the end user?</p>

        <p>Nginx is a brilliant little HTTP server that I&rsquo;m using on this website to quickly serve static content.  It bothers me a (very) little that it doesn&rsquo;t correctly generate Etag headers for static content, however.  I&rsquo;m attempting to remedy that oversight by releasing an Nginx module: <code>nginx-static-etags</code>.</p>

        <p>Hopefully, you didn&rsquo;t notice a thing yesterday when I moved the site off my shared accelerator at Joyent, and onto a custom built slice at Slicehost.  That was very much the goal.  Briefly, I&rsquo;ll go through the steps I took to make the transition as smooth as possible both before the launch and directly afterwards.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s been quite some time since I put any serious effort into mikewest.org.  I&rsquo;ve had tons of work, I&rsquo;ve been burnt out, I&rsquo;ve been complacent&hellip; the excuses pile on top of each other, each valid, each sufficient, none satisfactory.  For the sake of my own sanity, I need to start working on personal projects again.  Last week&rsquo;s GitHub dump was the first step in that direction.  Consider this relaunch to be the second.</p>
