        <p>I’m currently in the process of gutting my website, and rebuilding it piece by piece.  I suspect I’m doing this to distract myself from the fact that I don’t seem to have anything interesting floating around my head to write about. Rather that catalog the failings of the system I’m replacing (for they are legion), in this article I’d like to touch on the carefully considered bits I’m keeping around.</p>

        <p>I’m trying to do something with the Flickr API that I consider to be relatively trivial. I have the impression that the API is fighting me every step of the way. Why, oh why, can’t the wonderful people who designed Del.icio.us’s new API hop over to Flickr and slap together something that makes sense from the perspective of the end user?</p>

        <p>Nginx is a brilliant little HTTP server that I’m using on this website to quickly serve static content.  It bothers me a (very) little that it doesn’t correctly generate Etag headers for static content, however.  I’m attempting to remedy that oversight by releasing an Nginx module: <code class="highlighter-rouge">nginx-static-etags</code>.</p>

        <p>It’s been quite some time since I put any serious effort into mikewest.org.  I’ve had tons of work, I’ve been burnt out, I’ve been complacent… the excuses pile on top of each other, each valid, each sufficient, none satisfactory.  For the sake of my own sanity, I need to start working on personal projects again.  Last week’s GitHub dump was the first step in that direction.  Consider this relaunch to be the second.</p>
