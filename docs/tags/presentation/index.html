        <p>This is a quick summary of a presentation I gave last week at Google’s second CMS Security Summit, held here in Munich. TL;DR: Injection attacks are bad, isolation is lacking, and I’m looking forward to more collaboration on both fronts.</p>

        <p>I had the distinct pleasure of talking with folks at this year’s CSSConf EU about the dangers of content-injection attacks. They’re not just for JavaScripters, you see: CSS is dangerous too! They’ve just posted the video, and I think it’s worth a little under a half-hour of your time to skim through.</p>

        <p>Last week, I was in Zürich to chat about client-side security. Here, I’ve wrapped up an annotated transcript, along with the slides and video. I’m pretty happy with how the talk turned out: I think it’s a good representation of what I think is important in frontend security, and worth your time to peruse.</p>

        <p>At the end of last year, I presented ‘Securing the Client Side’ at Devoxx, and I’ve been meaning to put together a more accessible version of the talk for those who weren’t there. I think the topics are important, and worth the effort of updating this site for the first time in a year. <em>cough</em>.</p>

        <p>Back in November, I presented twice at the Google Developer Day in Tel-Aviv. The first of those talks has been uploaded, and I spent most of the afternoon transcribing it to post here. I wanted to give the audience (you!) an introduction to screen readers, and to building accessible websites and applications. I think it was pretty successful, and I hope you enjoy it if you watch at home.</p>

        <p>Yesterday at the Silicon Valley GTUG meetup, I gave a presentation introducing the IndexedDB API.  I’ve thrown the slides on Slideshare, but the transcription there is absolutely miserable.  I’ll reproduce it here in a readable format, and add a few notes where appropriate.</p>
