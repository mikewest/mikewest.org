            <p>I had the distinct pleasure of talking with folks at this year’s CSSConf EU about the dangers of content-injection attacks. They’re not just for JavaScripters, you see: CSS is dangerous too! They’ve just posted the video, and I think it’s worth a little under a half-hour of your time to skim through.</p>

            <p>Last week, I was in Zürich to chat about client-side security. Here, I’ve wrapped up an annotated transcript, along with the slides and video. I’m pretty happy with how the talk turned out: I think it’s a good representation of what I think is important in frontend security, and worth your time to peruse.</p>

            <p>After working with Blink’s implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">window.onerror</code> a little bit over the last week or so, I’m somewhat amazed that anyone ever used it for anything at all. Happily, we’ve made some big improvements in the last week or two that I think it’s worth highlighting here.</p>

            <p>At the end of last year, I presented ‘Securing the Client Side’ at Devoxx, and I’ve been meaning to put together a more accessible version of the talk for those who weren’t there. I think the topics are important, and worth the effort of updating this site for the first time in a year. <em>cough</em>.</p>
