I like the ideas it espouses, and have made a few improvements to it’s core.  Here, I’ll point out some highlights of my fork in the hopes that they see usage beyond this site.</p>

            <p>While I agree fully with many of the conclusions Lukas Mathis draws in an excellent essay on the recent Google/Douglas Bowman split, a few bits deserve further study.  In general, engineers understand and can relate well to automated A/B testing, and designers understand and can relate well to more personal usability testing.  The two are, however, not the same, don’t provide the same data, and ought not be conflated.</p>

            <p>My DSL connection is really quite fast; I’m apparently only ~800m away from the nearest DSLAM, and so I should in theory be capable of maxing out the connection.  This holds up pretty well in speed tests: I get great downstream, and passable upstream scores when connecting to pretty much anything in Europe.  All told, I should be thrilled with my service, but I’m not, because it only seems to actually <em>work</em> about 80% of the time.</p>

I’m coming to realize that what I (in hindsight) like <em>most</em> is probably the piece of software I thought about the <em>least</em> positively, namely Yahoo’s mostly centralized and completely open bug tracking system: Bugzilla.  We abused it more than a bit, attempting to layer task and project management on top of a system that wasn’t really designed to support it, but all told, Bugzilla made my work life better.</p>
