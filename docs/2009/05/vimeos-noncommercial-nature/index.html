  <p>Vimeo’s asked <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Armet</a> to take down his Instapaper Pro demo video.  <a href="http://www.marco.org/102376812">His response</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Vimeo usually makes good policy decisions. But their complete prohibition of anything that can remotely be considered for commercial purposes, even with a paid Plus account, doesn&#8217;t strike me as particularly necessary. I really don&#8217;t see why this is the right move.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can sympathize with Marco’s frustration.  Vimeo is probably the highest-quality video site on the net.  The player is minimal, and better thought-out than most that I’ve seen elsewhere.  The community is engaged and excellent in a way that YouTubers never will be, and the discovery tools are as good as Flickr’s (which is high praise indeed).  From that perspective, it’s exactly the right place to post a commercial video that you want people to watch, and get excited about.</p>

<p>However, I believe that Vimeo is a great place to get the right kind of attention for your product <em>precisely because</em> they’ve had an explicitly “personal” ethos from the start.  They’ve built up a community of creative <em>people</em> who want to share their creations and <em>life</em> with the world, and the policy decisions they’ve settled upon are focused on maintaining that community experience.  Opening that up to commercial exploitation would be intensely counter-productive; YouTube is evidence of that.  It’s clear to me that Vimeo would be a worse place were it to allow itself to be overrun with moneymaking ventures…</p>

<p>In some ways, this is a shame, as projects like <a href="http://instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> and <a href="http://birdhouseapp.com/">Birdhouse</a> are definitely best of breed in terms of supportable business opportunities.  And, honestly, they’re examples of <em>personal</em> products in a way that Vimeo probably wasn’t thinking about when they codified their standards.  But I can sympathize with their position: Vimeo has taken a hard line against commercial activity (as well as other sorts of activity that don’t fit their model: <a href="http://vimeo.com/blog:140">video game captures</a> for instance), and making exceptions for cool products from cool business ventures simply isn’t sustainable.</p>

<p>As much as I love Instapaper (and <a href="http://mikewest.org/2009/03/Instapaper-is-amazing" title="Mike West: 'Instapaper is Amazing'">I love Instapaper</a>), Vimeo isn’t the right place for it to be advertised.</p>
