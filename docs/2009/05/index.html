            <p>Mark Nottingham has put together a really useful tool that aids in the analysis of the behavior of HTTP resources.  I’ve started putting together a command line version based on the web version he’s released on GitHub.</p>

            <p>Yahoo’s latest API is really quite cool: Placemaker takes your unstructured data (e.g. any HTML page, RSS feed, etc), and extracts a nice list of <em>locations</em> that your data refers to.</p>

            <p>While I agree fully with many of the conclusions Lukas Mathis draws in an excellent essay on the recent Google/Douglas Bowman split, a few bits deserve further study.  In general, engineers understand and can relate well to automated A/B testing, and designers understand and can relate well to more personal usability testing.  The two are, however, not the same, don’t provide the same data, and ought not be conflated.</p>

            <p>My DSL connection is really quite fast; I’m apparently only ~800m away from the nearest DSLAM, and so I should in theory be capable of maxing out the connection.  This holds up pretty well in speed tests: I get great downstream, and passable upstream scores when connecting to pretty much anything in Europe.  All told, I should be thrilled with my service, but I’m not, because it only seems to actually <em>work</em> about 80% of the time.</p>

            <p>Varnish is an excellent-looking ‘HTTP accelerator’, designed specifically as a high-performance caching reverse-proxy to sit in front of your hard-working application servers, and relieve them of load.  It’s a bit of a pain in the ass to install from source on JeOS, though.</p>

            <p>So.  W3C has quite decent installation instructions for the HTML validator, but it makes a few assumptions about a typical linux environment that don’t actually hold true if you’re running a stripped down JeOS distro in a virtual machine.</p>
