  <p>I just spent the last half-hour screwing around with my Vim configuration to set up a &ldquo;more perfect&rdquo; writing environment.  Fullscreen!  Eighty columns!  Proper line-wrapping!  Large, readable font!  Markdown syntax highlighting!  Spellcheck!  Etcetera, etcetera!  Hilariously wrongheaded, of course, since I created this environment <em>instead of</em> writing anything.  Likewise, I&rsquo;ve played around with <a href="http://todotxt.com/">todo.sh</a> quite a bit in the last week or two (it&rsquo;s nice), trying to put together a good system for recording my ever-growing list of things I need to take care of.  Perhaps there&rsquo;s a reason that the list is ever-growing.</p>

<p>Building new bash scripts that make recording tasks easier might <em>feel</em> like Doing Important Work, but it isn&rsquo;t.  Not really.  This is unfortunately true even when &ldquo;write new bash scripts to make recording tasks easier&rdquo; is on my newly created todo list.</p>

<p>This is a long way of saying that <a href="http://www.marco.org/about">Marco Arment</a> is <a href="http://www.marco.org/182893582">dead on</a>:</p>

  <p>The best way to increase your productivity, hack your life, and be
  minimalist is to stop reading those sites.</p>

<p>Also, hello Internet.  It&rsquo;s been a while.</p>
