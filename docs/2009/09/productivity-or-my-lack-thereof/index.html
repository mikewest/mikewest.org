  <p>I just spent the last half-hour screwing around with my Vim configuration to set up a “more perfect” writing environment.  Fullscreen!  Eighty columns!  Proper line-wrapping!  Large, readable font!  Markdown syntax highlighting!  Spellcheck!  Etcetera, etcetera!  Hilariously wrongheaded, of course, since I created this environment <em>instead of</em> writing anything.  Likewise, I’ve played around with <a href="http://todotxt.com/">todo.sh</a> quite a bit in the last week or two (it’s nice), trying to put together a good system for recording my ever-growing list of things I need to take care of.  Perhaps there’s a reason that the list is ever-growing.</p>

<p>Building new bash scripts that make recording tasks easier might <em>feel</em> like Doing Important Work, but it isn’t.  Not really.  This is unfortunately true even when “write new bash scripts to make recording tasks easier” is on my newly created todo list.</p>

<p>This is a long way of saying that <a href="http://www.marco.org/about">Marco Arment</a> is <a href="http://www.marco.org/182893582">dead on</a>:</p>

<p>Also, hello Internet.  It’s been a while.</p>
