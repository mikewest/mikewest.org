  <h1>Mike West's brief bio</h1>
  <p>I’m a web developer.  I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that <em>delight</em> and <em>inform</em>.  I do it well.</p>

<p>I’m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction.  I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.  The <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/following">list of projects I follow</a> on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I’d prefer to be using, and <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/starred/rss/203164/fvc7FjLu4aIN5wsniOahrlWgbLw">my Instapaper “Starred” list</a> will give you a glimpse into the reading material I find interesting enough to share.</p>

<h2 id="professional-bio">Professional Bio</h2>

<p>At the moment, I’m a developer advocate on Google’s Chrome team in Munich, Germany.</p>

<p>From January 2010 to November 2011, I was part of the team responsible for the web presence of one of the largest daily newspapers in Germany: <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/">Sueddeutsche.de</a>.  It’s a big site, running on a surprisingly antiquated backend; we work hard to keep things running smoothly, and to meet the high expectations of our users.  Generally, we did a pretty good job of it.</p>

<p>Before Sueddeutsche, I worked for Yahoo! on their equally massive European news sites.  My team and I took <code class="highlighter-rouge">news.yahoo.com</code>’s solid codebase, and made it localizable for distinct markets and languages: we were directly responsible for building and maintaining Yahoo!’s news sites in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, relaunching all five within a year.  We laid the foundation for further work that expanded the platform’s scope to include Singapore and beyond.  We did <em>good</em> work while understaffed and under pressure, and I’m proud of our accomplishments.</p>

<p>In addition to my in-house work, I’ve written a variety of articles on development for publications such as <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/about/contributors/mike_west/">DigitalWeb</a>, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/authors/w/mikewest">A List Apart</a>, and Opera’s <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/education/curriculum/">Web Standards Curriculum</a>.  I enjoy what I do, and I enjoy sharing tidbits with others.</p>

<h2 id="personal-bio">Personal Bio</h2>

<p>A slight clarification of the above: I’m actually a philosophy student <em>cleverly disguised</em> as a successful web developer.  Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult to make a living sitting under a tree while reading Kant, I’ve focused my energies on the web, which happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.</p>

<p>I moved to Germany from Texas a few years back, learned the language, and have settled in Munich for the time being.  I think I’ll stick around here for a while…</p>
