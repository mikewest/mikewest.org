            <p>New Year&rsquo;s resolutions come in all shapes and sizes; if you&rsquo;re a web developer stuck for good ideas of things you could do to improve the world (or at least the tiny chunk of it that&rsquo;s concerned with web performance and security) I&rsquo;d like to propose two: secure all your websites, and use a cookieless domain for static assets.</p>

            <p>Back in November, I presented twice at the Google Developer Day in Tel-Aviv. The first of those talks has been uploaded, and I spent most of the afternoon transcribing it to post here. I wanted to give the audience (you!) an introduction to screen readers, and to building accessible websites and applications. I think it was pretty successful, and I hope you enjoy it if you watch at home.</p>

            <p>I had the opportunity to present a few demos during the Chrome section of Saturday&rsquo;s Google Developer Day in Berlin (which, incidentally, was a blast). I expect a video to go up at some point in the vaguely near future, but, since I got more than a few questions about it, I&rsquo;m throwing the links up here as a stopgap before the video&rsquo;s released.</p>

            <p>Based on the Content Security Policy primer I wrote last week, you should have a good idea of what CSP can offer a website developer. What might not be clear is that the policies can extend beyond HTTP, a bit more deeply into the browser. Chrome offers Content Security Policy support for extensions that substantially reduce the possibility of permission leakage; this article describes how it works, and how you can use it in your extensions.</p>

            <p>The web&rsquo;s security model is fundamentally broken, and has been since the beginning. Content Security Policy is an upcoming feature of the web platform that promises to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks, and it&rsquo;s worth starting to play with now.</p>

            <p>With a simple Wi-Fi packet-sniffer, intercepting login cookies over the air is far easier than it ought to be. Happily, clever people have put together solid mitigation techniques, one of which is HTTP Strict Transport Security. I&rsquo;ve implemented it on a personal site, this article describes what it is, why it&rsquo;s important, and how you can use it yourself.</p>

            <p>Dave Winer ends an otherwise quite reasonable piece about his concern at Facebook&rsquo;s &ldquo;frictionless sharing&rdquo; with a non sequitur attack on Chrome for, as far as I can tell, nothing it&rsquo;s actually doing.</p>

            <p>I sat down with Technikwürze&rsquo;s Marcel Böttcher way back at the beginning of February to talk about the exciting new release of Chrome 9 to the stable channel, and a few other bits and pieces of the Chrome ecosystem. That interview (in German) is just now seeing the light of day as Technikwürze 178.  After listening to it last night, I think it generally went pretty well, modulo a few small mistakes on my part.</p>

            <p>Git makes it incredibly easy to work on a lot of a project&rsquo;s features at once, hopping quickly back and forth between branches. I love this ability, but I hate remembering what exactly it was that I was working on in a particular branch. I know it had something to do with a particular bug, but I&rsquo;ve no idea anymore which files I was fiddling around with to fix it. Here&rsquo;s my solution to that problem.</p>
