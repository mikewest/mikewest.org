  <p>Recently, I wrote a <a href="/2008/11/the-inspiration-of-ownership" title="Mike West: 'The Inspiration of Ownership'">short article</a> on the effect a team’s sense of ownership in it’s projects can have on the finished product.  The <a href="/2008/11/mike-has-been-laid-off">surprising twist</a> in my professional life last week has led me back onto the same train of thought, but I’m coming to it from a slightly different angle.  I discussed “ownership” in a narrow sense, relating to a team’s involvement with and responsibility for decisions made about a project’s vision and direction.  This isn’t the only way in which the word has impact; one also has “ownership” of a project in the broader sense of pure possession.</p>

<p>A relatively famous study offered a representative sample of students a straight choice between a bar of chocolate and a coffee mug.  Opinions were split: neither bars nor mugs were substantially preferred.  If, however, a group was <em>given</em> one, and then asked if they’d like to trade it for the other, surprisingly few would.  Even though the items were roughly equivalent in the abstract, <em>possession</em> (however brief) seemed to imbue them with irrationally high value.  <em>My</em> coffee mug is much more important <em>to me</em> than some random bar of chocolate with which I have no relationship, even if I’ve only had <em>my</em> mug for a few minutes.  Even if it’s a bit chipped and cracked, it’s <em>mine</em>, and that counts for something.</p>

<p>The economist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thaler" title="Wikipedia: 'Richard Thaler'">Richard Thaler</a> coined the term “endowment effect” to describe this phenomenon, and I’m reminded very strongly of it as I start looking around for a new job.  Now that my projects at Yahoo! have been taken from me, I’m starting to wonder whether I perhaps I’ve been valuing them more than I rationally ought.  There are a lot of good jobs out there, and I’m relatively sure of finding one quite quickly.  Perhaps <em>my</em> job wasn’t the best for me after all.  Perhaps that bar of chocolate across the room is significantly tastier than I expect.  Perhaps.</p>

<p>This, of course, is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to rationalize to myself the thought that it’s really not all that bad to have my position yanked out from under me.  It’s not quite working.</p>

<p>Yet.</p>
