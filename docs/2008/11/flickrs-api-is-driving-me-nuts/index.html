  <p>I&rsquo;m trying to do something with the Flickr API that I consider to be relatively trivial. I have the impression that the API is fighting me every step of the way. Why, oh why, can&rsquo;t the wonderful people who designed Del.icio.us&rsquo;s new API hop over to Flickr and slap together something that makes sense from the perspective of the end user?</p>

<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to have a list of my flickr sets as a block on my homepage, displaying the most recent sets in the order they were published, along with some simple metainformation and a thumbnail.  I&rsquo;d also like to display photosets in my <a href="/archive">archive pages</a>, interspersed throughout the rest of the content at the proper point in the timeline.</p>

<p>Most of this is easy to get with a single call to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photosets.getList.html"><code>flickr.photosets.getList</code></a>.  The XML that&rsquo;s returned looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;rsp stat="ok"&gt;
&lt;photosets&gt;
    &lt;photoset id="[ID GOES HERE]" primary="2914968443" secret="[SECRET GOES HERE]" server="3007" farm="4" photos="2" videos="0"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;2008-10 - Driving&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;description /&gt;
    &lt;/photoset&gt;
    ...
&lt;/photosets&gt;
&lt;/rsp&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Simple enough to parse, and in combination with Flickr&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html">standardized url structure</a>, this gets me relatively close to the data that I&rsquo;m looking for.  The small bit that&rsquo;s missing is an actual publication date, which is significant for my plans.  Without it, I can&rsquo;t correctly insert the photosets into my archive pages, and so far as I can tell, the data simply isn&rsquo;t exposed via the API.  So let&rsquo;s dig around a bit.</p>

<p>Since I know what the primary photo is for the photoset, I can grab it via <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getInfo.html"><code>flickr.photos.getInfo</code></a>, which gets me the photo&rsquo;s dates:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;rsp stat="ok"&gt;
&lt;photo id="2914968443" secret="[SECRET GOES HERE]" server="3007" farm="4" dateuploaded="1223227911" isfavorite="0" license="3" rotation="0" originalsecret="c87ab26ef7" originalformat="jpg" media="photo"&gt;
	...
	&lt;dates posted="1223227911" taken="2008-10-04 18:12:42" takengranularity="0" lastupdate="1223283362" /&gt;
    ...
&lt;/photo&gt;
&lt;/rsp&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Leaving aside the strange change of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.dates.html">timestamp format</a>, and the nonsensical lack of timezone information, I can mash those into the photoset data to get an approximation of it&rsquo;s creation date.  That works pretty well, actually.  It means, however, that I have to make an additional API request for <em>each</em> photoset.  That&rsquo;s more than a little annoying.</p>

<p>But now I have all the information I need, so putting the code together is straightforward.  Straightforward, that is, until I start thinking about the necessity to automatically update this data periodically.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://delicious.com/help/api">Del.icio.us API</a> is really good about handling this scenario:
<a href="http://delicious.com/help/api#posts_all"><code>posts/all</code></a> returns all the your bookmarks, and allows you to <em>filter</em> the list by tag or date range.  If I know, for instance, that I last polled for changes at 10:00 this morning, I can ask Del.icio.us to send me only the bookmarks that came in <em>after</em> that point in time.  This makes the update-handling code on my end quite simple: I ask for all the updates since the last bookmark I&rsquo;ve stored locally, and when I get a response, I treat the whole thing as new.</p>

<p>Flickr doesn&rsquo;t, so far as I can tell, support the same mechanisms.  This has the effect of pushing validation down to my layer: I grab a list of all my photosets and then walk through the list, checking locally to see if I&rsquo;ve already got the information stored.  This is stupendously inefficient, and actually becomes <em>more</em> inefficient as time goes on and I add more photosets.</p>

<p>The closest Flickr comes to the Del.icio.us level of efficiency is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getRecent.html"><code>flickr.photos.getRecent</code></a>, which returns a list of up to 500 recent photos.  It doesn&rsquo;t, however, provide the same benefit as the Del.icio.us feed, as it doesn&rsquo;t allow you to specify what &ldquo;Recent&rdquo; means.  It simply pulls a set number of photos off the top and throws them back over the wall.</p>

<p>I would <em>love</em> to see something like the Del.icio.us functionality added to the Flickr API. It would make my particular use case quite a bit simpler, and if applied across the board, it would make the entire Flickr API better suited to the polling-based tasks it&rsquo;s being put to.</p>
