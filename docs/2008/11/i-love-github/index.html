  <p>Over the last two or three weeks, a substantial subset of my friends and colleagues have started using <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> to host some of their personal projects.  I&rsquo;m really enjoying this influx, and it&rsquo;s inspiring in a way I didn&rsquo;t really expect.  GitHub has done nothing less than to make my friend&rsquo;s coding activity <em>visible</em> to me, and mine visible to them.  This doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, but it&rsquo;s simply transformative; If this is how &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people feel about Facebook, then I can start to understand how it&rsquo;s captured so much mindshare.</p>

<h2 id="coding-in-the-open">Coding in the Open</h2>

<p>Visibility is inspiration and accountability.  Watching talented developers Get Things Doneâ„¢ around me gives me impetus to start putting something together of my own.  <a href="http://neilcrosby.com/">Neil</a> was creating a new repository every day at one point, and <a href="http://marknormanfrancis.com/">Norm</a>&rsquo;s potential set of projects is great to see.  The whole group of Londoners are setting an example I&rsquo;d like to live up to, and at the same time generating gentle social pressure for me to build something exciting of my own.  Watching practically everyone I know fork <a href="http://github.com/norm/homedir/tree/master">Norm&rsquo;s <code>homedir</code></a> immediately after he put it online is simply brilliant.  I want that to happen to <em>my</em> projects.  You couldn&rsquo;t ask for better, more constructive peer pressure.</p>

<p>To that end, I&rsquo;m putting as much of my current code as possible out into the open.  I&rsquo;m not generating a whole lot of code that I&rsquo;d expect to be of use to anyone but myself at the moment, but even so, I <em>work harder</em> when I know that people I respect will be seeing what I&rsquo;m producing.  I&rsquo;m coding for myself, but an audience changes the way I think about what I&rsquo;m doing; The simple fact that my friends are following my progress on GitHub is reason enough to try to exceed their expectations.</p>

<p>Moreover, I&rsquo;ve been able to convince myself that even <em>robot&rsquo;s</em> opinions matter.  Just knowing that <a href="http://calendaraboutnothing.com/">CalendarAboutNothing</a> is <a href="http://calendaraboutnothing.com/~mikewest">watching my every commit</a> gives me reason to make sure that I make a little bit of time every day to sit down and write something resembling quality code.  It&rsquo;s a simple thing, and has been much more effective than I thought it would be over the last ~2 weeks. I highly recommend trying it out; soon you&rsquo;ll be just as hooked on big red X&rsquo;s as I&rsquo;ve become.</p>
