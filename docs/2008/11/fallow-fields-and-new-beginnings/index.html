  <p>It&rsquo;s been quite some time since I put any serious effort into mikewest.org.  I&rsquo;ve had tons of work, I&rsquo;ve been burnt out, I&rsquo;ve been complacent&hellip; the excuses pile on top of each other, each valid, each sufficient, none satisfactory.  For the sake of my own sanity, I need to start working on personal projects again.  Last week&rsquo;s <a href="/2008/10/gently-abandoning-dead-to-me-projects">GitHub dump</a> was the first step in that direction.  Consider this relaunch to be the second.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history">A Brief History</h2>

<p>The design has been sitting in my head and strewn across my hard drive in a few overlapping HTML files for months now.  The site as it stands today is most clearly influenced (both in form and function) by <a href="http://tomayko.com/about">Ryan Tomayko</a>, and his <a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/administrative-debris">stark interpretation</a> of Tufte&rsquo;s admonitions against &ldquo;administrative debris&rdquo;.  I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to go quite as clean as Ryan, mostly because I was rapidly becoming enthralled with <a href="http://jontangerine.com/about/">Jon Tan</a> and his absolutely <a href="http://jontangerine.com/">gorgeous site</a>.  I owe my current obsession with Baskerville to him.</p>

<p>I had mockups finished in June or July that more or less look like what you&rsquo;re seeing now.  I didn&rsquo;t, however, have the heart to put them up on top of the site as it sat.  Until today, mikewest.org was running on <a href="http://textpattern.com/">TextPattern</a>, which is a fine CMS indeed, but one whose intricacies I&rsquo;ve never been able to fully wrap my head around.  It&rsquo;s also stunningly inefficient.  Everything in TextPattern is a database hit; usually several.  The content is in the database, the templates are in the database, the plugins are <em>serialized PHP</em> that sits in the database, and so on.  Doing anything at all in TextPattern requires some not insignificant amount of processing power, and caching isn&rsquo;t something that&rsquo;s built in.  </p>

<p>TextPattern wasn&rsquo;t the CMS I wanted to use going forward, but I had neither the inclination nor the time to investigate all the options that were out there.  Hosted services seemed like a copout (I&rsquo;m a <em>webdev</em>, damnit!), and the rest seemed like too much work to get going.</p>

<p>So mikewest.org sat, empty, alone, partially broken, and unmaintained.  A sad website indeed.</p>

<h2 id="and-then">And then&hellip;</h2>

<p>A month or two ago, <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/" title="Carlo Zottmann">Carlo</a> re-introduced me to <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>, and something clicked.  If I simply sat down and <em>wrote</em> myself a <em>new</em> blogging engine I could solve the problems I saw with my TextPattern installation.  Moreover, I could experiment with <a href="http://git.or.cz/" title="Git: Fast Version Control System">git</a> and teach myself <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby Programming Language">ruby</a> at the same time.  After a few guys at the office convinced me of the beauty of setting <em>everything</em> up myself at <a href="http://slicehost.com/">slicehost</a>, I was on my way. This was really just what I needed: a quick <code>git init</code> later, and <a href="https://github.com/mikewest/fallow/tree">Fallow</a> was born.</p>

<p>As experiments go, this has been terrifically successful.  I&rsquo;ve built myself a new blog from scratch in a little under a month, using a distributed version control system I&rsquo;d never touched, and a language I knew nothing about.  I sincerely doubt anyone in the world will touch any of the code I&rsquo;ve put out, but putting it out <em>feels good</em>.</p>

<h2 id="fallow-in-a-nutshell">Fallow in a nutshell</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mikewest/fallow/tree">Fallow</a> is firmly grounded in three principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Markdown is a wonderful, wonderful thing; why would I need an admin interface when I have TextMate?</li>
  <li>Static content shouldn&rsquo;t be generated twice.  It&rsquo;s <em>static</em>, after all.</li>
  <li>Databases aren&rsquo;t, strictly speaking, <em>necessary</em> for a simple blog like mine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accordingly, Fallow uses flat Markdown files as data sources for articles, flat YAML for bookmarks, and regenerates a tagging and caching Sqlite3 database on the fly after every deployment.  Article pages and old archive pages render HTML once, and cache it out to a static HTML document on the server, which is served to all subsequent users.  The homepage and tag pages are currently fully dynamic, but I&rsquo;ll get around to resolving that shortly.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a ton of fun to build, and I intend to go into a bit more detail of some of the design decisions in the future.  But first, I need to get some more functionality built in.  Flickr and Twitter sync is coming, as are a plethora of tag-based Atom feeds, etc.  There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/fallow/tree/master/README.markdown" title="Fallow's README and TODO.">lot of work left to do</a>, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever actually be done.</p>

<p>But I have a side project again.  I&rsquo;m enjoying that.  :)</p>
