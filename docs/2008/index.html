            <p>Yesterday, Yahoo! made some announcements regarding The Future&trade; of many of their high profile properties.  Specifically, they&rsquo;re (slowly) opening up, enabling third-party developers to build applications that can be seen on and interact with your My Yahoo! page, or your mailbox.  I think this is a great step, and one I wish they&rsquo;d made <em>before</em> they laid me off.</p>

The surprising twist in my professional life last week has led me back onto the same train of thought, but I&rsquo;m coming to it from a slightly different angle.</p>

            <p>Over the last two or three weeks, a substantial subset of my friends and colleagues have started using GitHub to host some of their personal projects.  I&rsquo;m really enjoying this influx, and it&rsquo;s inspiring in a way I didn&rsquo;t really expect.  GitHub has done nothing less than to make my friend&rsquo;s coding activity <em>visible</em> to me, and mine visible to them.  This doesn&rsquo;t sound like much, but it&rsquo;s simply transformative; If this is how &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people feel about Facebook, then I can start to understand how it&rsquo;s captured so much mindshare.</p>

            <p>On the bus home from work, I was listening to this week&rsquo;s On the Media. In particular, I was struck by a great interview with the man who designed the field-organizer and volunteer training programs for Barack Obama&rsquo;s campaign: Marshall Ganz.  If you&rsquo;re at all interested in the political angle, I&rsquo;d suggest you listen.  If you&rsquo;re at all interested in how I&rsquo;m planning to apply this seemingly unrelated topic to the technical field of web development (et al), keep reading.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m trying to do something with the Flickr API that I consider to be relatively trivial. I have the impression that the API is fighting me every step of the way. Why, oh why, can&rsquo;t the wonderful people who designed Del.icio.us&rsquo;s new API hop over to Flickr and slap together something that makes sense from the perspective of the end user?</p>

            <p>Nginx is a brilliant little HTTP server that I&rsquo;m using on this website to quickly serve static content.  It bothers me a (very) little that it doesn&rsquo;t correctly generate Etag headers for static content, however.  I&rsquo;m attempting to remedy that oversight by releasing an Nginx module: <code>nginx-static-etags</code>.</p>

            <p>The &lsquo;Overton window&rsquo; is a bit of political jargon that describes how politicians influence the perceptions and debates that go on among the voting public.  In this thinly veiled (but mercifully short) rant, I argue that it&rsquo;s equally applicable to my workplace.</p>
