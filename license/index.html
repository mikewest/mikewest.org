    Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 Unported License</a>.  Among
other things, this means that your are free to share bits of this website's content
under the following conditions:

1.  You must **attribute** the work to me in a reasonable way (I'd suggest a
    link back to the original source in a way that makes it clear where the
    material originated).
    
2.  Your use must be **non-commercial**.  If you're _selling_ the content of
    this website, or using it in order to increase your ad-revenue in some way,
    then you're operating outside this license agreement, which isn't good.

3.  You must distribute the content **without modification**.

Noted Exceptions
----------------

1.  The _content_ of the site is available for you to share.  This does not
    include the site's _layout_.  I do not intend for this to be a theme you
    apply to your own content.  Build on top of it, morph it, tweak it, but
    _make it your own_ before reusing bits for your own inspired projects.
    I'd be the last to claim that everything about this website is original,
    I'm standing on the shoulders of much better designers than I.  But I
    _implemented_ every bit myself, and I expect you to do the same.
    
2.  I didn't think it needed clarification, but this license explicitly
    excludes the content of my [bio][].  Please write your own [bio][].

For any other use, or questions about these conditions, please
