I"Ó<p>In the same spirit as this weekâ€™s <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/revisioncontrol" title="A List Apart: 'I Wonder What This Button Does'">revision control article</a>, I ran across a <a href="http://bradchoate.com/weblog/2006/07/27/oscon-subversion-best-practices" title="Brad Choate: 'OSCON: Subversion Best Practices'">great summary</a> of an <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8671">OSCON presentation entitled â€œSubversion Best Practicesâ€</a> (via: <a href="http://bradchoate.com/" title="Brad Choate">Brad Choate</a>).  Normally, Iâ€™d just stuff this into my linkroll and leave it at that, but this is really interesting material thatâ€™s worth talking about.  Ben Collins-Sussman &amp; Brian W. Fitzpatrickâ€™s (Subversion developers, and co-authors of <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/" title="Version Control with Subversion">â€œVersion Control with Subversionâ€</a>) presentation deals with the way Subversion is <em>actually used</em> on large software projects.  Two ideas that jumped out at me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Binary file modifications; or other files that canâ€™t be merged. Youâ€™d
want to lock such files to prevent conflicts.  Property svn:needs-lock
accommodates this. It checks out the file as read-only, and becomes
read/write once you lock it for modifications. If you try to lock and
canâ€™t, itâ€™s because someone else is working on the file.</li>
  <li>hotcopy versus rsync: Use hotcopy to make the backup to preserve
consistency, then use rsync on <strong>that</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I learned some things just by flipping through <a href="http://bradchoate.com/weblog/2006/07/27/oscon-subversion-best-practices" title="Brad Choate: 'OSCON: Subversion Best Practices'">Bradâ€™s summary of the presentation</a>, and Iâ€™m hoping a more detailed report pops up at some point soon, because it looks like there was some great client-side stuff in there that Bradâ€™s summary doesnâ€™t really give enough insight into.</p>
