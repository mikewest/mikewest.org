I"x<p>I’m in the process of transferring <a href="http://mikewest.org/">mikewest.org</a> away from <a href="http://godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>.  They’re crazy-cheap, but I just feel a tiny bit dirty every time I visit the website.  I don’t want to click through 3 tricky pages of upselling every time I touch a domain, I’m not particularly fond of the <a href="http://www.bobparsons.com/">guy running the place</a>, and the ads… oh the ads.</p>

<p>The registrar I’m testing out is <a href="https://www.gandi.net/">gandi.net</a>.  I’ve read nothing but good things about their service, and they seem solid.  Moreover, they seem solidly on the side of the customer in domain ownership disputes.</p>

<p>So, if the website disappears for a bit, it’s because something crazy happened in the world of domain registrars.  I don’t expect that to happen, but you never know…</p>
