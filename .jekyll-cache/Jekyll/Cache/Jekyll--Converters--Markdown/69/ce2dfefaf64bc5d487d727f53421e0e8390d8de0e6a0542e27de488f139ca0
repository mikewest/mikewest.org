I"Ã<p>Last year, I jumped on the opportunity to sit down and write some articles for Operaâ€™s Web Standards Curriculum.  I bit off a bit more than I could chew, and Chris Mills exhibited the patience of a saint as I finished the first quickly, the second slowly, the third <em>very</em> slowly, and then completely failed to deal with the rest.  Regardless, those were released along with the rest of the JavaScript bits to complete the curriculum.</p>
