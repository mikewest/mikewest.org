    <p>The <em>content</em> of the site is available for you to share.  This does not
include the site’s <em>layout</em>.  I do not intend for this to be a theme you
apply to your own content.  Build on top of it, morph it, tweak it, but
<em>make it your own</em> before reusing bits for your own inspired projects.
I’d be the last to claim that everything about this website is original,
I’m standing on the shoulders of much better designers than I.  But I
<em>implemented</em> every bit myself, and I expect you to do the same.</p>
