I"ü<p>Iâ€™ve had a few bits of code floating around on the site for 2-3 years now without any serious investment of effort on my part.  Itâ€™s time to throw in the towel, admit that Iâ€™m never actually going to touch them again, and set those loose under a liberal license.</p>

<h2 id="datarequestor"><a href="http://github.com/mikewest/datarequestor/tree/master" title="GitHub: 'DataRequestor'">DataRequestor</a></h2>

<p>DataRequestor was a tiny project started in 2004 to solve some user interface issues we ran into while I was working at <a href="http://www.bbaaviationero.com/node/5">Dallas Airmotive</a>.  Itâ€™s a simple Ajax library, written before Ajax had a name.  Despite well intentioned statements to the contrary, I simply havenâ€™t touched the code since early 2005.  Iâ€™m proud of itâ€™s heritage, but itâ€™s not something I use anymore, and itâ€™s well outclassed and out-debugged by the frameworks that have become available in the meantime.</p>

<p>So, Iâ€™m <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/datarequestor/tree/master" title="GitHub: 'DataRequestor'">releasing the code</a> under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mit_license" title="Wikipedia: 'MIT License'">MIT license</a>.  Itâ€™s up on GitHub (which Iâ€™m beginning to <em>love</em>) now.  Itâ€™s yours for the forking.</p>

<h2 id="mcw_templates"><a href="http://github.com/mikewest/mcw_templates/tree/master" title="GitHub: 'mcw_templates'">mcw_templates</a></h2>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">mcw_templates</code> is a solid Textpattern plugin that enables the export and import of Textpattern templates, something so basic that Iâ€™m still shocked itâ€™s not officially part of the distribution.  Iâ€™m using Textpattern less and less, and now that Iâ€™m in the process of writing my own blog software, itâ€™s pretty clear that Iâ€™m never going to touch this plugin ever again.</p>

<p>So, Iâ€™m <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/mcw_templates/tree/master" title="GitHub: 'mcw_templates'">releasing the code</a> under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mit_license" title="Wikipedia: 'MIT License'">MIT license</a>.  Itâ€™s up on GitHub now, and itâ€™s yours for the forking.</p>

<h2 id="perfecttime"><a href="http://github.com/mikewest/perfecttime/tree/master" title="GitHub: 'PerfectTime'">PerfectTime</a></h2>

<p>Could PerfectTime have been more pompously named?  Blame _why, <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/showingPerfectTime.html" title="Whytheluckystiff: 'Showing Perfect Time'">it was his idea</a>.  This is a small JavaScript library that automatically converts timestamps on a page into the userâ€™s timezone.  Useful, but not to me.  Iâ€™ve developed <a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/access/AccessibilityOfDateTimeMicroformat" title="Mike Davies: 'The accessibility of the date-time pattern in Microformats'">doubts about itâ€™s accessibility</a>, and even more doubts about itâ€™s widsom in general.  That said, itâ€™s a decent little tool that Iâ€™m never going to touch again.</p>

<p>So, Iâ€™m <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/perfecttime/tree/master" title="GitHub: 'PerfectTime'">releasing the code</a> under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mit_license" title="Wikipedia: 'MIT License'">MIT license</a>.  Itâ€™s up on GitHub now, and itâ€™s yours for the forking.</p>
