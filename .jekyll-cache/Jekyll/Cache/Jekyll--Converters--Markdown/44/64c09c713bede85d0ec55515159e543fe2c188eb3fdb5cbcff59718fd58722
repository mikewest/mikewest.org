I"<p>I tried to install the latest iPhone 3.0 beta firmware on my decidedly-not-3G iPhone last night, and failed miserably.</p>

<p>I’m currently stuck on a pink “connect to iTunes” screen, and each new try at restoring the beta firmware throws “unknown error” 1012.  Trying to roll back to the current stable firmware doesn’t work either: it throws a 1604 error.</p>

<p>I’m sifting through forums and the like at the moment, and I’ll probably end up at the Apple Store at some point in the relatively near future so that a Genius can look at my phone, do the exact same things I’m doing now, and then shrug hopelessly and ask for my credit card.  <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>I did see some amusing error messages in the console, though:</p>
