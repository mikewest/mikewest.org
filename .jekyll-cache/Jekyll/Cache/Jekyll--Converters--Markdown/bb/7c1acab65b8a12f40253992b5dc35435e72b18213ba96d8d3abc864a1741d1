I"¦<p>Iâ€™m currently in the process of gutting my website, and rebuilding it piece by piece.  I suspect Iâ€™m doing this to distract myself from the fact that I donâ€™t seem to have anything interesting floating around my head to write about. Rather that catalog the failings of the system Iâ€™m replacing (for they are legion), in this article Iâ€™d like to touch on the carefully considered bits Iâ€™m keeping around.</p>
