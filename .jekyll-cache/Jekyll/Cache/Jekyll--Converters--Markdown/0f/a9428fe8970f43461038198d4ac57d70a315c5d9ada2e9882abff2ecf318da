I"Å<p>Yesterday, Yahoo! made some announcements regarding The Future‚Ñ¢ of many of their high profile properties.  Specifically, they‚Äôre (slowly) opening up, enabling third-party developers to build applications that can be seen on and interact with your My Yahoo! page, or your mailbox.  I think this is a great step, and one I wish they‚Äôd made <em>before</em> they laid me off.</p>
