I"Ë<p><a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/" title="Carlo Zottmann">Carlo</a> just launched his latest project, <a href="http://escaloop.com/" title="Escaloop: Combine up to 20 RSS feeds to build a lifestream badge for your site">Escaloop</a>.  Itâ€™s a nicely structured way of creating a <a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/lifestream/" title="Carlo's life on the internets">lifestream</a> that pulls in your content from external sites (flickr, last.fm, etc), binding them together into a nicely presented, embedable â€œbadge.â€</p>

<p>Heâ€™s done a good job with it, and it couldnâ€™t be easier to try out for yourselfâ€¦  You donâ€™t even have to create a user account to get going (in fact, you <em>canâ€™t</em> create a user account: they donâ€™t exist!).  Itâ€™s lightweight, and easy to play around with.  Go <a href="http://escaloop.com/" title="Escaloop: Combine up to 20 RSS feeds to build a lifestream badge for your site">try it out</a>, youâ€™ll like it!</p>
