I"¶<p>Itâ€™s been quite some time since I put any serious effort into mikewest.org.  Iâ€™ve had tons of work, Iâ€™ve been burnt out, Iâ€™ve been complacentâ€¦ the excuses pile on top of each other, each valid, each sufficient, none satisfactory.  For the sake of my own sanity, I need to start working on personal projects again.  Last weekâ€™s GitHub dump was the first step in that direction.  Consider this relaunch to be the second.</p>
