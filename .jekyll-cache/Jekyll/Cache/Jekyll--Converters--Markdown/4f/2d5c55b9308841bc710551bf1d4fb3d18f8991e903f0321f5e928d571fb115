I"Ÿ<p>Git makes it incredibly easy to work on a lot of a projectâ€™s features at once, hopping quickly back and forth between branches.

I know it had something to do with a particular bug, but Iâ€™ve no idea anymore which files I was fiddling around with to fix it. Hereâ€™s my solution to that problem.</p>
