I"„<p>Git makes it incredibly easy to work on a lot of a projectâ€™s features at once,
hopping quickly back and forth between branches. I love this ability, but I
hate remembering what exactly it was that I was working on in a particular
branch. I know it had something to do with a particular bug, but Iâ€™ve no idea
anymore which files I was fiddling around with to fix it.</p>

<p>Enter <code class="highlighter-rouge">git vim</code>. Iâ€™ve set up two trivial alias in my <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.gitconfig</code> file to
either show me a list of files effected by a particular revision or range, and
to directly open them in my editor of choice so that Iâ€™m back to work as
quickly as possible.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[alias]
  ...
  fshow = ! sh -c 'git show --pretty="format:" --name-only $1 | grep -v "^$" | uniq | sed -e "s#^#`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`/#"' -
  vim   = ! sh -c 'vim `git fshow $1`' -
  mate  = ! sh -c 'mate `git fshow $1`' -
  edit  = ! sh -c '$EDITOR `git fshow $1`' -
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first alias calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">git show</code> to get a list of all the files touched by a
revision or range, filters out empty lines, and ensures that the paths are
absolute after deduplicating the list of files. Any
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitrevisions.html">valid revision or range</a> will work: <code class="highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">37ad159</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">master..</code>, etc.</p>

<p>To see a list of files changed over the last four revisions, I could type:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git fshow HEAD~5..
lib/rocco/layout.rb
lib/rocco/layout.mustache
lib/rocco.rb
rocco.gemspec
test/helper.rb
test/test_reported_issues.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To open those files for editing, Iâ€™d use the second alias:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git vim HEAD~5..
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If I wanted to open the files in TextMate instead, Iâ€™d use the third:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git mate HEAD~5..
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or, if I was clever enough to set up an <code class="highlighter-rouge">$EDITOR</code> environment variable (which
I should do, given that itâ€™s used all over the place on the shell), I could
use the last alias to open the files in whatever program that was set to:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git edit HEAD~5..
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I can hop from branch to branch, and open all the relevant files quickly and
easily. Itâ€™s a small thing, but itâ€™s made a big difference in my workflow
over the last week or three.</p>
