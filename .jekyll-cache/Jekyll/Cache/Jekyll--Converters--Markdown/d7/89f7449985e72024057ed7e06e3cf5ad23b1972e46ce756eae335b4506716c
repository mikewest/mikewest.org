I"T<p>Yahoo! News has <a href="http://uk.news.yahoo.com/" title="Yahoo! News UK">relaunched in the UK</a>.  Finally.  This is the first project I’ve worked on at Yahoo!, and we’re proud to be “done.”  Still some kinks to work out of the system, and some CSS bugs we’re (of course) only seeing now, but we’ll get those worked out.</p>

<p>In the near future, the news platform will be rolled out to other European markets, starting with Spain.  For the moment, though, I’m going to go take a week-long nap.  Yahoooo!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: And now I’m reloading the <a href="http://digg.com/world_news/News_Site_overhaul_at_UK_Yahoo" title="Digg: News Site Overhaul at UK Yahoo!">digg thread</a> every 5 minutes, waiting for the first “YAH00 IZ L0OZ3RZ!” comments to start rolling in.  I’m a maschoist, apparently.  :)</p>
