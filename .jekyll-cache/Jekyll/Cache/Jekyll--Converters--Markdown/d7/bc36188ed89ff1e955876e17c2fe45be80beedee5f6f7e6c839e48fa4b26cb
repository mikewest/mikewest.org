I"²<p>I have writerâ€™s block.  Or writersâ€™ block.  A block that effects writers.  Writers, that group of which I am currently not part.  So maybe itâ€™s just a block.</p>

<p>I have block.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m in a position where I should have tons to write about.  I should be overflowing with ideas, and overwhelmed with exciting activities and projects that do nothing but fill my head with wonder, and force me to learn, force me to go beyond my current skillset, and to branch out in new directions.  But Iâ€™m not.  Iâ€™m a little bored, to be honest.  Weâ€™ve more or less wrapped up the project Iâ€™m on, and weâ€™ve done it with very little <em>real</em> input on my part.  Sure, Iâ€™ve done a ton of work, and spent nights and weekends getting things done, but none of it has been <em>creative</em>.  The creative work was done before I got there.  The interesting problems left to tackle were outside my roleâ€™s scope.</p>

<p>I helped whenever I could inject myself into the process; that was fun.</p>

<p>I talked to <a href="http://www.nodetraveller.com/" title="Lawrence Carvalho: One of the webdevs in London; great guy.">Lawrence</a> about it this morning, Iâ€™m confident that Iâ€™ll be <em>doing</em> things soon.  There are some interesting projects with a lot of potential on the horizon, and some interesting extensions to current project that might be enabled in the near future.  Thereâ€™s simply a ton of opportunity at Yahoo.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve spent the last 6 months learning the internal systems, and becoming proficient at the process of working at Yahoo.  Iâ€™m hopeful that the next 6 months will present challenges; I hope that Iâ€™ll be learning enough to be able to write valuably again.</p>

<p>Also, and unrelatedly, I watched the first two episodes of Heroes today on the train.  The show looks <em>good</em>.  Iâ€™m going to have to track down the rest of the episodes for the way backâ€¦  iTunes Music Store?  Meet my credit card.  :)</p>
