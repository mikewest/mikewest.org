I"«<p>I had the distinct pleasure of talking with folks at this yearâ€™s
<a href="http://2013.cssconf.eu/">CSSConf EU</a> about the dangers of content-injection attacks. Theyâ€™re
not just for JavaScripters, you see: CSS is dangerous too! Theyâ€™ve just posted
the video, and I think itâ€™s worth a little under a half-hour of your time to
skim through. Youâ€™ll be shocked to learn that <a href="https://mkw.st/r/csp">Content Security Policy</a>
makes an appearance.</p>

<p>Credit is due to <a href="https://cure53.de/">Mario Heiderich</a>, et al. for their excellent paper
<a href="http://www.nds.rub.de/media/emma/veroeffentlichungen/2012/08/16/scriptlessAttacks-ccs2012.pdf">â€œScriptless Attacks - Stealing the Pie Without Touching the Sillâ€</a>,
from which I stole much of the attack-based content. Awesome stuff.</p>

<p>Transcript is coming, but for now, please do enjoy the embedded video and
slides below:</p>

used Speaker Deck to <em>present</em> the slides from someone elseâ€™s laptop since my
computer decided not to connect to the conferenceâ€™s projector. I love you,
Speaker Deck!</p>
