I"Ç	<p>Iâ€™ve tried a few different methods to walk away from my Mac without worrying about jackass coworkers sending e-mails and IM messages on my behalf, and after a bit of experimentation with various screensavers and applescripts, finally hit upon a solution that Iâ€™m happy with. Itâ€™s pretty simple, and leverages the power of <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/triggers">Quicksilver triggers</a> to make the process of locking my computer absolutely second-nature.</p>

<h2 id="terminal-magic">Terminal Magic</h2>

<p>First, open up a terminal window, and copy and paste the following line:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>echo "alias lock='/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/user.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend; exit;'" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This adds an alias to your bash profile that gives you the ability to simply type lock at the command line to securely suspend your current session. I always have a terminal window open, so this was a good first step for me, and might reasonably be enough for you if youâ€™re also a terminal geek. However, adding <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> into the mix makes the process more flexible.</p>

<h2 id="triggers">Triggers</h2>

<p>We can create a trigger to bind a hotkey to the terminal command weâ€™ve just created. Whenever I hit ???\, my computer locks itself down; itâ€™s trivial.</p>

<p>Bring up Quicksilverâ€™s preference screen by hitting your Quicksilver hotkey (mineâ€™s bound to ?-Space), then ?-Comma. Select â€œTriggersâ€ from the menu at the top, then create a new custom trigger by hitting the plus button near the bottom and selecting â€œHotkey.â€ Set this new trigger to run our lock command by hitting â€œ.â€ to enter text entry mode, typing â€œlockâ€, then tabbing to the next field and selecting â€œRun a Text Command in Terminalâ€ (if you donâ€™t have this command, make sure the Terminal plugin is installed).</p>

<p>Once the trigger is created, give it a hotkey by double clicking on the trigger (or clicking on the â€œinfoâ€ icon in the bottom right-hand corner), then clicking on the â€œHot Keyâ€ field, and hitting the keys youâ€™d like to assign. I chose ???\ because it requires both hands, and isnâ€™t something I could possibly hit by accident.</p>

<p>And thatâ€™s all there is to it! You can now lock your computer with impunity! Enjoy your new-found power.</p>
