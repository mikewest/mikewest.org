I"ª<p>I sat down with TechnikwÃ¼rzeâ€™s Marcel BÃ¶ttcher way back at the beginning of February to talk about the exciting new release of Chrome 9 to the stable channel, and a few other bits and pieces of the Chrome ecosystem. That interview (in German) is just now seeing the light of day as TechnikwÃ¼rze 178.  After listening to it last night, I think it generally went pretty well, modulo a few small mistakes on my part.</p>
