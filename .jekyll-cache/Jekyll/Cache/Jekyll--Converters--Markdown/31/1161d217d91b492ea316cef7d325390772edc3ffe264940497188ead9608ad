I"ý<p>I had the opportunity to present a few demos during the Chrome section of 
Saturdayâ€™s Google Developer Day in Berlin (which, incidentally, was a blast).
I expect a video to go up at some point in the vaguely near future, but, since
I got more than a few questions about it, Iâ€™ll throw the links up here with a
bit of background and credit for each. Incidentally, thanks to <a href="https://plus.google.com/116059998563577101552/">Paul
Kinlan</a> for taking <a href="https://plus.google.com/116059998563577101552/posts/18W2deUiGkB">some pictures</a> during the demos. Iâ€™m glad I have
something to show here as a stopgap before the videoâ€™s ready! <em><strong>Update</strong>: The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ92UEDPiZQ">keynote video</a> is up on YouTube, and embedded below.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111116/transitions.html">first demo</a> was pulled from a talk <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/">Mike Bostock</a> gave
just last week, highlighting the power of the impressive <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">D3.js</a>. D3 is a
free JavaScript library that makes it easy to bind data to a DOM, and then
generate stunning visualizations based on those bindings. His <a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/talk/20111116/#0">entire
presentation</a> is well worth checking out, and really highlight what an
often overlooked technology like SVG is capable of.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Next, I pulled out an oldie-but-goodie: <a href="http://blog.joelambert.co.uk/">Joe Lambertâ€™s</a> <a href="http://www.joelambert.co.uk/flux/transgallery.html">Flux
Slider</a>. Itâ€™s a quick demonstration of the power of CSS-based
transitions, and really well suited to venues like GDD, as it makes the
capabilities of modern browsers immediately visually apparent. If you havenâ€™t
seen it yet, take a look. Itâ€™s another open-source library, so fiddle with
<a href="https://github.com/joelambert/Flux-Slider/tree/master/js/src">the code</a> as well.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.joelambert.co.uk/flux/transgallery.html"><img src="/static_content/20111121-fluxslider.jpg" alt="Flux Slider is pretty, play with it!" /></a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, no HTML5 demo is complete without WebGL, and no WebGL demo is
complete without <a href="http://mrdoob.com/">Mr.doob</a> and <a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/">three.js</a>. I introduced the topic
by throwing a <a href="http://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/webgl/kinect/">huge, Kinect-driven Mr.doob</a> onto the wall behind me.</p>

    <p><a href="http://mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/webgl/kinect/"><img src="/static_content/20111121-mrdoob.jpg" alt="Mr.doob's Kinect-driven demo" /></a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I followed up the introduction with a <a href="http://alteredqualia.com/three/examples/webgl_terrain_dynamic.html">beautiful terrain rendering</a>
from <a href="http://alteredqualia.com/">AlteredQualia</a>. What I liked most about that demo is the fact
they theyâ€™ve pulled pieces from the <a href="http://ro.me/">ro.me</a> project to save time and
effort. Open source is brilliant.</p>

    <p><a href="http://alteredqualia.com/three/examples/webgl_terrain_dynamic.html"><img src="/static_content/20111121-terrain.jpg" alt="AlteredQualia's terrain demo" /></a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, I pulled the <a href="http://www.htmlfivewow.com/demos/audio-visualizer/index.html">HTML5 Wow Visualizer</a> from <a href="https://plus.sandbox.google.com/118075919496626375791/">Eric</a> and
<a href="http://blog.roomanna.com/">Arne</a>â€™s excellent <a href="http://www.htmlfivewow.com/">I/O 2011 presentation</a>. Itâ€™s still the best
WebAudio API demo out there, clearly demonstrating the power of the analyzer
and showing off things that simply arenâ€™t possible with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">audio</code> tag.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>And thatâ€™s it. Fiveish quick demos in about five minutes. I enjoyed it! What did
you think?</p>
