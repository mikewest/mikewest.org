I"ý<p><a href="http://de.news.yahoo.com/" title="Yahoo! Nachrichten">Yahoo! Nachrichten</a> in Germany and <a href="http://it.notizie.yahoo.com/" title="Yahoo! Italia - Notizie Yahoo!: ultime notizie dall'Italia e dal mondo">Yahoo! Notizie</a> in Italy are finally live.  Itâ€™s been a bit of a struggle getting these sites launched, especially in the wake of Spainâ€™s super smooth run out the door.  Still, itâ€™s nice to have these sites out there; theyâ€™re a huge improvement (if I do say so myself) over the old versions, much cleaner and easier for the producers to update, and standards based for all the right reasons (ignore the ampersands in the ad code, pleaseâ€¦).</p>

<p>Four countries downâ€¦ only France to go.  Thatâ€™ll happen soon, I believe.</p>
