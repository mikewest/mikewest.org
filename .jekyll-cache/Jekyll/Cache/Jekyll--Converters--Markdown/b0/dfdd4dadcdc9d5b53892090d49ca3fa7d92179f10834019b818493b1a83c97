I"o<p><a href="http://carlo.zottmann.org/">Carlo</a> sent me a <a href="http://pownce.com/">Pownce</a> invite today.  I think I played with <a href="http://twittr.com/">Twittr</a> for about 10 minutes before giving up… Pownce looks a little nicer, and it’s about time I try to figure out what’s so exciting for the crazy kids these days (I’m apparently <em>old</em> now, or at least out of touch… :) ).</p>

<p>If you’re so inclined, <a href="http://pownce.com/mikewest/">my Pownce profile</a> is sitting around, waiting for people to find me.  And if you’d like an invite, I’ve got a very few remaining.</p>
