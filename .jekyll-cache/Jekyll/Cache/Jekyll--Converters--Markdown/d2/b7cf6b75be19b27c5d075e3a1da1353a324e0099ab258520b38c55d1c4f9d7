I"È<p>Letâ€™s say, hypothetically, that you have a <em>funny</em> coworker named Uli.  In that case, it might interest you to know that you can <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302545">pair an Apple remote with your mac</a> so that only <em>your</em> remote can activate Front Row.  That would probably save you a moment or two of confusion when Front Row starts popping up inexplicably while youâ€™re typing.</p>

<p>Jackass.  :)</p>
