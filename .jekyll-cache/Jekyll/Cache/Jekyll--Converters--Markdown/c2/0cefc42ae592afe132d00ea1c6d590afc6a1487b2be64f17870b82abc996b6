I"´	<p>This election â€œyearâ€ has gone on longer than I thought possible, and each time I pop open NetNewsWire to sift through my vaguely-political set of feeds, Iâ€™m stunned that weâ€™re still disagreeing about some things, and equally stunned that weâ€™ve <em>begun</em> to disagree about other things as if they were reasonable topics of debate.  Obama as communist socialist fascist terrorist?  Really?  How did we get there?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window" title="Wikipedia: 'Overton Window'">Overton window</a> is an attempt to explain these shifts in political dialog.  Overton posited that there is a particular range of ideas deemed â€œpolitically acceptableâ€ to the public at large.  Ideas outside this range are regarded as â€œfringeâ€ or â€œextremeâ€ and are therefore politically difficult to embrace successfully.  Further, Overton argues that itâ€™s actually possible to shift this window of acceptability in one direction or another by promoting ideas <em>even more</em> extreme than then â€œfringeâ€ position youâ€™d really like to advocate.  By introducing a bold claim thatâ€™s pinned way past the outer edge of public opinion (â€œObama is a Marxist.â€), you prime the electorial public to more readily accept your real position (â€œObama is <em>totally</em> too liberal.â€) as a very reasonable compromise and valid area of discussion.  Your fringe position is made palatable by the perception of an even more extreme view.  â€œObamaâ€™s no terrorist, thatâ€™s for sure!â€, the public will say, â€œBut I guess I <em>am</em> a little worried about his patriotismâ€¦â€</p>

<p>It struck me today that the Overton window is probably applicable beyond politics.  It can explain some things in the workplace as well.  In short, when youâ€™ve shifted your perception of the reasonable range of day-to-day â€œnormalâ€ far enough away from what really might <em>be</em> â€œnormalâ€, normalcy starts to look pretty strangeâ€¦ pretty extreme.  And certainly far too difficult to attain, even if that normalcy <em>was</em> desirable.  Which it probably isnâ€™t.  I mean, â€œproductivityâ€?  No reasonable person wants <em>that</em>!  Thatâ€™s a <em>fringe</em> idea, buddy.</p>

<p>This is a long way of saying that my work is driving me more-than-usually insane at the moment.  Maybe I need to stop advocating my perceived normalcy, and start advocating <em>extreme</em> normalcy.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll let you know how that goes.</p>
