I"-<p>This morning, I can happily announce the publication of my latest article, <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/revisioncontrol" title="A List Apart: 'I Wonder What This Button Does'">‚ÄúI Wonder What This Button Does‚Äù</a>, in the 220th issue of <a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>.</p>

<p>The article is a fairly light and non-technical look at my favourite development tool: Subversion.  I hope this introduction to revision control inspires a few of you to dive in and try things out in your own projects.  I think you‚Äôll be shocked both at how easy it is to get things going in a revision controlled environment, but also at how <em>freeing</em> it is, knowing that you no longer have to <em>worry</em> about irrevocably breaking something.</p>

<p>After reading <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/revisioncontrol" title="A List Apart: 'I Wonder What This Button Does'">the article</a>, I hope you‚Äôre looking for a little more information about getting started with Subversion.  There‚Äôs really no better general-purpose resource than <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/" title="Version Control with Subversion">‚ÄúVersion Control with Subversion‚Äù</a>.  It‚Äôs got all the information you‚Äôll need to get started, and goes into far more breadth and depth than you‚Äôll probably ever need.</p>

<p>Additionally, I‚Äôve collected a few articles that pinpoint specific pieces of Subversion, detailing methods for tweaking Subversion to meet your needs.  Enjoy!</p>

    <p><a href="http://mikewest.org/archive/working-with-subversion-file-properties">Working with Subversion File Properties</a></p>

    <p>Subversion has a very powerful system for associating metadata with the
files you have under version control. This article describes how to
automate the process of adding properties to the files you put under
version control using <code class="highlighter-rouge">auto-props</code>.</p>

    <p><a href="http://mikewest.org/archive/subversion-post-commit-hooks-101">Subversion Post-Commit Hooks 101</a></p>

    <p>Subversion‚Äôs system of ‚Äúhooks‚Äù allows you to trigger scripted responses to
your interactions with your repositories.  This article maps out the
‚ÄúHello World‚Äù of hooks: using <code class="highlighter-rouge">SVNnotify</code> to send out e-mails to your 
project team every time a new revision is committed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://mikewest.org/archive/forbidden-errors-and-subversion-commits">‚ÄúForbidden‚Äù Errors and Subversion Commits</a></p>

    <p>Since Subversion can run over HTTP, it‚Äôs easy to cause problems for
yourself with wayward <code class="highlighter-rouge">mod_rewrite</code> rules.  This article notes one such
conflict scenario, and provides an easy solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://mikewest.org/archive/leveraging-modrewrite">Leveraging <code class="highlighter-rouge">mod_rewrite</code></a></p>

    <p>Continuing in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">mod_rewrite</code> vein, you‚Äôll want to make sure that the 
hidden directories that Subversion generates aren‚Äôt available for general
consumption.  This article, among other things, shows you how to use
<code class="highlighter-rouge">mod_rewrite</code> to block requests for those directories that you‚Äôd rather
the world not see.</p>

    <p>Dan Benjamin rocks.  This article of his spells out in exacting detail the
(simple) process of compiling Subversion from source and installing it on
OS X.  Why would you do this when you could just <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html">grab the
binaries</a>?  Because it‚Äôs fun, that‚Äôs why.</p>
