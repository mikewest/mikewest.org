I"â<p>I liked many things about working at Yahoo.  Iâ€™m coming to realize that what I (in hindsight) like <em>most</em> is probably the piece of software I thought about the <em>least</em> positively, namely Yahooâ€™s mostly centralized and completely open bug tracking system: Bugzilla.  We abused it more than a bit, attempting to layer task and project management on top of a system that wasnâ€™t really designed to support it, but all told, Bugzilla made my work life better.</p>
