I"Š<p>One question youâ€™re almost certainly not asking yourself is â€œWhatâ€™s Mike West been up to?â€  Thatâ€™s a shame, really, as Iâ€™ve got some projects floating around that Iâ€™m proud of, and that Iâ€™d like to share with you. Moreover, Iâ€™d like to point out the project documentation pages that Iâ€™ve put together as a meta-project; I think itâ€™s worth your time to take a look.</p>
