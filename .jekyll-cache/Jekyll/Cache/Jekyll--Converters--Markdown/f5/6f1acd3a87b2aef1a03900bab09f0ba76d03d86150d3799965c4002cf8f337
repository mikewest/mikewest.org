I"6<p>Over the last two or three weeks, a substantial subset of my friends and colleagues have started using GitHub to host some of their personal projects.  I’m really enjoying this influx, and it’s inspiring in a way I didn’t really expect.  GitHub has done nothing less than to make my friend’s coding activity <em>visible</em> to me, and mine visible to them.  This doesn’t sound like much, but it’s simply transformative; If this is how “normal” people feel about Facebook, then I can start to understand how it’s captured so much mindshare.</p>
