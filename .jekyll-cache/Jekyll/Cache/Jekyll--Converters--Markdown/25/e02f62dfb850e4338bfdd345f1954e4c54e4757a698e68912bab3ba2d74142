I"ï<p>Today we <a href="http://fr.news.yahoo.com/" title="Yahoo! ActualitÃ©s - Yahoo! ActualitÃ©s France">relaunched the Y! News site in France</a>!  Itâ€™s been a long time coming, but weâ€™re finally out of the deep grass of deployment.  Iâ€™m looking forward to implementing some new features over the coming months instead of fixing smaller and smaller bugs ahead of launch.  :)</p>

<p>Phase 1 of EU deployment is done.  Weâ€™re moving on to the exciting land of Phase 2.  Thrilling, eh?</p>
