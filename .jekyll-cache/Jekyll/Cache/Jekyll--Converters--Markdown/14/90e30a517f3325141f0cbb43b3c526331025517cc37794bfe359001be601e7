I"≈[<p>In the previous <a href="/2005/03/event-handlers-and-other-distractions">two</a> <a href="/2005/03/component-encapsulation-using-object-oriented-javascript">articles</a> on the topic, we‚Äôve outlined methods for hooking JavaScript behaviors onto events on your pages, and ways of encapsulating those behaviors so that they don‚Äôt interfere with any other JavaScript goodness your site may be sporting. We‚Äôve been careful to ensure that the added behaviors are just that: additions or enhancements that don‚Äôt effect the usability or accessibility of the page for those browsing without the benefit of JavaScript. But let‚Äôs be honest, the examples have been a bit boring thus far. We changed the colours of some table rows.</p>

<p>Yippie.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs be a little more adventurous in our enhancements: Let‚Äôs make everyday, run of the mill <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> boxes a bit more interesting (and usable!) by adding a type-ahead search.</p>

<p>How do we start on a project like this? The first thing to do is to map out how we want the action to proceed. If we don‚Äôt have a good goal in mind, we stand a good chance of wandering off into the dark and getting lost. I think that the best method from a pedagogical standpoint is something like the following: We‚Äôll add a button next to each <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> element we want to be able to search through. Clicking that button will pop up a nicely styled <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> field that we can type into. As we type into that field, the associated <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> box will automatically jump to the value we‚Äôre typing in. So typing ‚Äúmi‚Äù into a list containing ‚ÄúBob Smith‚Äù, ‚ÄúFrank Jones‚Äù, ‚ÄúMike West‚Äù, and ‚ÄúZed Zebra‚Äù would jump instantly to ‚ÄúMike West.‚Äù That makes sense, and could really help out if we‚Äôre dealing with a list that‚Äôs a little longer than 4 elements. Just for fun, let‚Äôs also stipulate that I should be able to type the up or down arrow to scroll through the select box while I‚Äôm typing, and that hitting enter should hide the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> field. That sounds pretty useful, right? It‚Äôs not the ideal way from a usability perspective, but it‚Äôs going to give us a chance to really dive into some DOM functionality and give us lots of events to hook into, which makes it perfect to teach with. :) As a last item, we‚Äôre going to stipulate that each of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> boxes we work with be pre-sorted. It would be pretty simple to adapt the script to deal with unsorted lists, but if we stipulate that the lists are pre-sorted, we can make it work much, much more quickly.</p>

<p>So, once we‚Äôve got that map solidly in place, we can start in on the coding. Initially, we‚Äôll need to come up with a nice package name that distinguishes this widget from any other we might come up with in the future. I‚Äôve chosen ‚ÄúTypeAheadSelect‚Äù, feel free to branch out from that on your own; it‚Äôs fairly arbitrary. With the name chosen, we‚Äôll go ahead and create the package:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>function TypeAheadSelect () {
    var self = this;
    ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looks good so far. We‚Äôve set up an alias for <code class="highlighter-rouge">this</code> in order to bypass some scoping issues that might crop up later, and we‚Äôve got everything wrapped in a function to provide a namespace to work within. What next?</p>

<p>We‚Äôll tackle the remaining tasks one at a time: first, we‚Äôll generate a list of the elements we want to work with. But how do we know which those are? We can pretty easily generate a list of all the <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> elements on the page with a simple call to <code class="highlighter-rouge">getElementsByTagName</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var allSelects = document.getElementsByTagName('select');
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But we probably don‚Äôt want to apply this functionality to all of our select boxes. A simple yes/no toggle certainly wouldn‚Äôt need it, and we wouldn‚Äôt want to apply it to any <code class="highlighter-rouge">selects</code> that already have <code class="highlighter-rouge">onChange</code> events associated with them. We really want to add the behavior to only those <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> elements that we specify beforehand‚Ä¶ but how? We‚Äôve really got two methods: class names, or <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/scripttriggers/">custom attributes</a>. The former‚Äôs trivial, and I used it in the example code for the previous two articles. We simply come up with a descriptive class name, and apply it to the relevant <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> elements:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;select class='typeAheadable'&gt;
    &lt;option value='0'&gt;Hi!&lt;/option&gt;
    ...    
    &lt;option value='1'&gt;Bye!&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That certainly makes sense, but it‚Äôs arguably non-semantic in more or less the same way that <code class="highlighter-rouge">class='blue'</code> causes problems. Strictly speaking, they‚Äôre both really just presentational. Neither class name carries with it any <strong>semantic</strong> designation. It‚Äôs a minor quibble, but it could be a problem for you. (Of course, you could get around this argument by defining certain <strong>types</strong> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> boxes on your pages. You could have a ‚ÄúnameList‚Äù <code class="highlighter-rouge">class</code>, for instance, to describe the list we talked about earlier. That would carry semantic meaning, and would remain quite hookable. The tradeoff is that we‚Äôd lose some of our code‚Äôs genericness. Instead of being able to easily drop into any site, we‚Äôd end up hard-coding a list of classes it should apply to. That tradeoff might or might not be worth it to you, depending on your reaction to the next method I‚Äôll discuss.)</p>

<p>The other method is to define your own addition to the XHTML spec (as discussed at length in <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/scripttriggers/">this ALA article</a>), and add a custom attribute to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> elements you‚Äôd like to enhance. This carries with it a bit of a burden, in that you‚Äôll have to <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/customdtd/">define your own DTD</a> in order to make your site validate. This is the method I‚Äôm going with in this article, just because it gives me a chance to talk about attribute nodes and other geeky tech stuff like that. In the same vein as attributes like <code class="highlighter-rouge">multiple</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">selected</code>, our attribute (<code class="highlighter-rouge">typeAheadable</code>) could look something like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;select typeAheadable='typeAheadable'&gt;
    &lt;option value='0'&gt;Hi!&lt;/option&gt;
    ...    
    &lt;option value='1'&gt;Bye!&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With that choice in mind, let‚Äôs tackle the problem at hand. We‚Äôve already got the first part of our solution: the code that grabs all the <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> elements on the page. To that, we‚Äôll need to add a loop in order to iterate through the list, a test to see if the particular <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> we‚Äôre looking at is one we should work with, and then the code to actually put our new functionality into place. This ends up looking something like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>self.instantiate = function () {
    var allSelects = document.getElementsByTagName('select');
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; allSelects.length; i++) {
         if (allSelects[i].getAttribute('typeAheadable')) {
            self.addFilter(allSelects[i]);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">getAttribute</code> code is probably the only part of that that you don‚Äôt already understand, but it‚Äôs fairly self-explanatory. It returns the value of the attribute you specify, or null if the attribute doesn‚Äôt exist. Very simple, very useful. If the attribute is specified, we call <code class="highlighter-rouge">addFilter</code> in order to do the heavy lifting, if not, we ignore the <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code>.</p>

<p>If we wanted to do a class name based test, we could easily replace the <code class="highlighter-rouge">if</code> statement‚Äôs condition with something like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if (allSelects[i].className.match(/typeAheadable/)) {
    ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That would work just as well.</p>

<p>Regardless of which method you choose, let‚Äôs go ahead and create the new elements we‚Äôre going to be working with. We‚Äôll want a button to press in order to toggle the visibility of our text field, and we‚Äôll also need the text field itself. Let‚Äôs look at the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> field first. It‚Äôs functionality is pretty straightforward: as we type, we want to check the keys we‚Äôre pressing to see if they‚Äôre the up arrow, the down arrow, the enter key, or just some other character. We‚Äôll bind a function to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> element‚Äôs <code class="highlighter-rouge">onkeyup</code> event to handle that check.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// Create the element
typeAheadInput = document.createElement("input");
// Give it a type: in this case 'text'
typeAheadInput.setAttribute('type', 'text');

/*
    This is important: we set the 'haystack' property of our INPUT
    element to a reference to our master SELECT element.  This powerful
    feature of JavaScript enables us to talk to the SELECT element 
    in our INPUT element's event handler, which is critical.

    We'll see later where `obj` is coming from.  For the moment, just 
    keep it in mind as a question I need to answer for you.
*/
typeAheadInput.haystack = obj;

/*
    The heavy stuff: this binds an anonymous function to the INPUT
    element's onkeyup event in order to intercept the keypresses 
    and parse them in order to determine what to do.
*/
handleEvent(
    typeAheadInput, 
    'keyup',
    function(e) {
        if (!e) {
            /*

                to merge the two systems together.
            */
            e        = window.event;
        }
        var theInput = this;

        var keycode = e.keyCode;

        switch (keycode) {
            case 38: // up arrow
                /*
                    We want to respond to the up arrow by moving the current

                    the top of the list, so we get the maximum value: 0, or 
                    the currentIndex - 1.  So if we're at the 8th value, 
                    we'll move to the 7th, but if we're already at the top, 
                    we'll stay at the 0th (numbering starts at 0 in JavaScript)

                    If it's not the up/down arrow, or the enter key, then process
                    it by telling the SELECT box to set itself to the correct value.
                    We'll talk about telling the SELECT element how to do that in 
                    a few moments.
                    
                    The timeout code is here in order to deal with fast typists: we
                    don't want to tell the SELECT box to filter itself for every keypress
                    if we're in the middle of typing a word.  That would slow things 
                    and potentially cause problems if the value of the INPUT field 
                    changed during the middle of an event.  So we store a timer that
                    waits 25 milliseconds before telling the SELECT object (stored in 
                    this.haystack) to filter itself using the currently typed-in text.
                    
                    Every time a key is pressed, we clear out that timer, and reset it
                    for another 25 milliseconds.  That solves our problem.

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That‚Äôs the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> field in a nutshell. Not too tough, right? We just create the element, and give it a function to handle the keyup event. Hopefully the commented code makes sense, because it‚Äôs going to get a little more complex later on. :) For strictly presentational reasons, I‚Äôm going to wrap the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> inside of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> so that we can give it some nice borders and background colours. We‚Äôll give this <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> a class of ‚ÄòtypeAheadBox‚Äô, since it‚Äôs a box that contains a type ahead search widget. Let‚Äôs create that now and append the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> element inside it, that‚Äôs pretty trivial:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var typeAheadBox       = document.createElement('div');
typeAheadBox.className = "typeAheadBox";
typeAheadBox.appendChild(typeAheadInput);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Two things are left now, we need to create the button that toggles the visibility of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> containing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> field, and we need to explain to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> element we started with how it‚Äôs supposed to be able to figure out which value it should jump to when we type something in.</p>

<p>The former‚Äôs easier, let‚Äôs get it out of the way:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var toggleButton             = document.createElement('input');
toggleButton.className       = "toggleButton";
toggleButton.filterContainer = typeAheadBox;
toggleButton.setAttribute('type', 'button');
toggleButton.setAttribute('value', 'Type Ahead!');

/*
    When we click on the button, we want to make the DIV containing our INPUT
    element visible, and position under the button, aligned with it's left edge.
    
    This javascript code is fairly self-explanatory, but if there are questions,
    I'll be happy to answer them in the comments section.
*/
handleEvent(
    toggleButton, 
    'click', 
    function (e) {
        if (!e) e = window.event;
        var theButton = this;
                  
        var theFilter = theButton.filterContainer;
        if (theFilter.style.display == "block") {
            // it's visible, so hide it:
            theFilter.style.display = "none";
        } else {
            // display it, and focus on it                              
            theFilter.style.display = "block";                            
            theFilter.childNodes[0].focus();                                
            theFilter.style.left    = (
                                        findPosX(theButton)
                                        - 
                                        theFilter.offsetWidth 
                                        + 
                                        theButton.offsetWidth
                                      ) + "px";

                                        findPosY(theButton)
                                        + 
                                        theButton.offsetHeight
                                      ) + "px";                                 
        }
    }
);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All that‚Äôs left now is the code that actually takes the search string that we‚Äôve typed in, and selects the proper option in our <code class="highlighter-rouge">select</code> box. The function takes a single argument (the text that it should look for), and processes the list accordingly:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>obj.filterSelf = function (needle) {

            the selectedIndex to -1 in order to deselect all
            the options.  Otherwise, we set it to 0 to choose
            the first option in the list.

            then your value must be before it in the list.  So reset `high` or
            `low` to the index of the current element, and repeat until you 
            find your value, or run out of items.

            At the end of the search routine, we'll either have a value of -1,

        Else, we ended up somewhere in the middle of the list, but didn't find
        the value we were looking for.  In that case, set the currentIndex to 
        the value just after the one we ended up on.

    if (
            theIndex == -1 
            || 
            needle == this.options[theIndex].text.toLowerCase()

<p>Take all of that code (the button, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> element, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">filterSelf</code> method), and wrap it up in the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>self.addFilter = function(obj) {
    ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is where the aforementioned <code class="highlighter-rouge">obj</code> comes from: it‚Äôs passed in when you instantiate the object.</p>

<p>Now that we‚Äôve got the proper behaviors associated with the proper events, it‚Äôs a simple matter of sticking the toggleButton and typeAheadBox into the flow of the document:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>obj.parentNode.insertBefore(toggleButton, obj);
obj.parentNode.insertBefore(typeAheadBox, obj);
obj.parentNode.insertBefore(obj, toggleButton);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We‚Äôll also set the currentIndex and currentFilters to 0 and ‚Äú‚Äù, just to ensure that everything works when we first start typing information into the system.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>obj.currentIndex = 0;
obj.currentFilter = "";
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And there you have it. All the code is packaged together in <a href="/projects/files/EventHandler/typeAheadSelectExample.html">this example file</a> for your perusal.</p>
