<p>My DSL connection is really quite fast; Iâ€™m apparently only ~800m away from the nearest DSLAM, and so I should in theory be capable of maxing out the connection.  This holds up pretty well in speed tests: I get great downstream, and passable upstream scores when connecting to pretty much anything in Europe.</p>

<p>All told, I should be thrilled with my service, but Iâ€™m not, because it only seems to actually <em>work</em> about 80% of the time.  Every 10 minutes or so, my DSL modem gets confused about exactly whatâ€™s going on and drops the connection, picking it up again about a minute later, and continuing on itâ€™s merry way with a new IP.  This wreaks havok with any sort of persistant-connection driven tool, be it SSH or IRC or Adiumâ€¦ drives me a bit nuts, actually.  Itâ€™s gotten bad enough over the last few weeks that even Elisabeth notices the problemâ€¦ :)</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been on the phone with <a href="http://www.hansenet.de/index.html">Alice</a> pretty regularly for a few weeks now, and itâ€™s the same every time: I call in, explain the problem to the first-line tech, who checks the logs, asks me what kind of modem I have, and passes me on to the second-line tech, who checks the logs, asks me what kind of modem I have, and runs a line test.  The line test is pretty much ok, but they pass it on to the third-line tech anyway.  The third-line tech does whatever it is that they do, and calls up a few hours later to tell me that they donâ€™t see any problem, but that theyâ€™ll replace something anyway.  Last week it was the splitter.  The time before that it was something in-between my apartment and the DSLAM.  Iâ€™m curious to see what itâ€™ll be this time.  Maybe the modem?</p>

<p>Iâ€™m actually not as frustrated about this as I could be.  The customer service has been more or less all that I could ask for (short of actually solving the problem, of course).  The reps are friendly, seem relatively knowledgeable, and donâ€™t treat me as though Iâ€™m the problem.  Iâ€™d love for them to actually track down the bugs and get them worked out so that I donâ€™t drop out of chat rooms every few minutes, but Iâ€™m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt so far.  This is a marked contrast to our previous dealings with <a href="http://www.t-online.de/">T-Online</a> and Telekom in general, with whom I now simply refuse to do business based on the absurdity of the customer experience.</p>

<p>In any event, theyâ€™re working on my DSL again, and Iâ€™m hoping the days of <code class="highlighter-rouge">mikewest_</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">mikewest__</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mikewest___</code> will soon be behind me.</p>
