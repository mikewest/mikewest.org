I"o<p>A few days ago, my landlord asked me if I was losing hair.</p>

<p><img src="/images/3.jpg" alt="I look nothing like this." style="float:left; margin-right:1em;" /></p>

<p>Today, Antonia told me that I bear a striking resemblance to a picture of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Zevon" title="Wikipedia: Warren Zevon">Warren Zevon</a> that was on the <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/" title="Yahoo! Music">homepage of Yahoo! Music</a>…  “not quite so drug-addicted, but in that direction.”</p>

<p>I think she meant it as a compliment, but that just casts sincere doubts on her taste in men.   According to Wikipedia, he was dying of cancer at the time.  I don’t particularly want to look like this picture.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if I should run out and shave, get an immediate haircut, and new glasses, or just be depressed about the whole thing.</p>
