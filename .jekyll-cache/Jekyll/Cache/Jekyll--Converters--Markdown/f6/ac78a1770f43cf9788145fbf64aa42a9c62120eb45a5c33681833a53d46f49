I"g<p>I had the opportunity to present a few demos during the Chrome section of Saturday’s Google Developer Day in Berlin (which, incidentally, was a blast). I expect a video to go up at some point in the vaguely near future, but, since I got more than a few questions about it, I’m throwing the links up here as a stopgap before the video’s released.</p>
