I"•	<p>Recently, I wrote a <a href="/2008/11/the-inspiration-of-ownership" title="Mike West: 'The Inspiration of Ownership'">short article</a> on the effect a teamâ€™s sense of ownership in itâ€™s projects can have on the finished product.  The <a href="/2008/11/mike-has-been-laid-off">surprising twist</a> in my professional life last week has led me back onto the same train of thought, but Iâ€™m coming to it from a slightly different angle.  I discussed â€œownershipâ€ in a narrow sense, relating to a teamâ€™s involvement with and responsibility for decisions made about a projectâ€™s vision and direction.  This isnâ€™t the only way in which the word has impact; one also has â€œownershipâ€ of a project in the broader sense of pure possession.</p>

<p>A relatively famous study offered a representative sample of students a straight choice between a bar of chocolate and a coffee mug.  Opinions were split: neither bars nor mugs were substantially preferred.  If, however, a group was <em>given</em> one, and then asked if theyâ€™d like to trade it for the other, surprisingly few would.  Even though the items were roughly equivalent in the abstract, <em>possession</em> (however brief) seemed to imbue them with irrationally high value.  <em>My</em> coffee mug is much more important <em>to me</em> than some random bar of chocolate with which I have no relationship, even if Iâ€™ve only had <em>my</em> mug for a few minutes.  Even if itâ€™s a bit chipped and cracked, itâ€™s <em>mine</em>, and that counts for something.</p>

<p>The economist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thaler" title="Wikipedia: 'Richard Thaler'">Richard Thaler</a> coined the term â€œendowment effectâ€ to describe this phenomenon, and Iâ€™m reminded very strongly of it as I start looking around for a new job.  Now that my projects at Yahoo! have been taken from me, Iâ€™m starting to wonder whether I perhaps Iâ€™ve been valuing them more than I rationally ought.  There are a lot of good jobs out there, and Iâ€™m relatively sure of finding one quite quickly.  Perhaps <em>my</em> job wasnâ€™t the best for me after all.  Perhaps that bar of chocolate across the room is significantly tastier than I expect.  Perhaps.</p>

<p>This, of course, is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to rationalize to myself the thought that itâ€™s really not all that bad to have my position yanked out from under me.  Itâ€™s not quite working.</p>

<p>Yet.</p>
