I"İ<p><a href="http://www.maxcase.info/">Max Case</a> dropped me an e-mail today, letting me know that the [SSHKeychain] repository <a href="http://trac.sshkeychain.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/changeset/96">logged a commit</a> for the first time in <a href="http://trac.sshkeychain.org/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/changeset/95">almost a year</a>.  This update fixes a small bug that needed to be <a href="http://leuksman.com/log/2006/12/24/sshkeychain/">worked around</a> to get a clean, stable, universal build of the application.  Iâ€™ve updated my <a href="http://mikewest.org/archive/building-sshkeychain-as-an-intel-binary/" title="Building SSHKeychain as an Intel Binary">SSHKeychain universal build instructions</a> accordingly.</p>

<p>Moreover, <a href="http://www.ambrero.nl/about/">Bart Matthaei</a> (SSHKeychainâ€™s author) has popped up <a href="http://www.sshkeychain.org/pipermail/developers/2007-January/">on the mailing list</a> this month, and it looks like weâ€™ll be getting an â€œofficialâ€ (beta) release sometime in the near future.  I use SSHKeychain on every machine I have, and my days would be much more tedious without it (do <em>you</em> remember all your SSH passwords?).  Iâ€™m happy to see itâ€™s not succumbing to bit rot.  :)</p>
