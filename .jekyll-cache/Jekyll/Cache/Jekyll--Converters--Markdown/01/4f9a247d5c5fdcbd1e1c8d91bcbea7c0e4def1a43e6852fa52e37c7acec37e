I"þ<p>Iâ€™ll be at Elisabethâ€™s parentsâ€™ house for the next few days, celebrating Christmas in the Black Forest.  I hope your holidays are relaxing and fun, and maybe white too, if youâ€™re into the whole snow thing.  I think I got enough of that last year to last a lifetimeâ€¦  :)</p>

<p>When I get back to civilization (ha!), my pre-New Yearâ€™s resolution is to tackle the hundreds and hundreds of unread messages in my inbox.  I owe many people many e-mails.  Many.</p>

<p>Happy holidays, Internet.</p>
