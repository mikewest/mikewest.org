I"u<p>I’m in Texas again for the first time in a year and a half…  Long flight yesterday, and I made the mistake of taking a “quick” nap shortly after arriving at my parents’ house.  Now it’s 4 in the morning, and I’m <em>wide</em> awake.  :)</p>

<p>I’ll be here for the next 2ish weeks.  Updates will be sporadic, e-mail response less so.  Until then…</p>
