I"Þ<p>Congratulations to the Singapore news team for todayâ€™s <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/" title="Yahoo! Singapore News">successful relaunch</a> of their news site!  They were able to take the code that the team here in Munich put together, modify it to meet their needs, and get the site launched on a very tight schedule.</p>
