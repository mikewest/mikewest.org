I"p<p>I said I’d write something about the @media Ajax conference, and I still plan to.  However, I’ve had other things on my mind the last day or two…  I work in interesting times.  Long story short, I’ll get to it.</p>

<p>While you wait on whatever crazyness I eventually put to paper, enjoy <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mikewest/sets/72157603291874144/" title="Mike West: @media Ajax photoset">these @media Ajax photos</a> on Flickr.  I’m still learning how to use this camera…  and I’m discovering that my lens is quite a bit harder to focus at f1.4 than I thought…  But I’m getting there.  :)</p>
