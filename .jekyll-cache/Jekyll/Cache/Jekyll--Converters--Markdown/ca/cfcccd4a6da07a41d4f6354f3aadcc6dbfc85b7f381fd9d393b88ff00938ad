User Interface Blog: 'Using YUI in Greasemonkey Scripts'">great article</a> on Yahoo’s User Interface blog, outlining the mechanism he’s come up with for loading elements of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/" title="Yahoo! UI Library">YUI library</a> into his Greasemonkey scripts.  It’s a powerful combination, and he’s done some hard work to make the two play together in a fairly transparent manner.  With his code in hand, [using YUI in Greasemonkey user scripts] is simply a no-brainer.</p>

It’s nice to have him sitting across the room when I have questions.  :)</p>

<p>And, honestly, I’ll be beyond thrilled if I can <em>ever</em> write an article in German with the apparent ease and elegance he’s demonstrated in this piece.  Nice work, Carlo.</p>
