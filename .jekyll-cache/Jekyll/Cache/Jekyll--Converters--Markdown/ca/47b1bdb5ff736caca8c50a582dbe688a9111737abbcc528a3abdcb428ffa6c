I"<p>So.  I’m looking for an apartment in Munich.  The “why” will have to wait a week or so to make sure everything’s solid, but the apartment-looking cannot.</p>

<p>If you know of a cozy little one-bedroom apartment somewhere near the center of the city that’s avaliable… well… <em>now</em>, I’d love it if you dropped me a line: <a href="mailto:mike@mikewest.org">mike@mikewest.org</a>.  Likewise, if you have general advice about the city, I’d love to hear it.  Until then, I’ll be digging through newspapers…</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I did find a decent place for the short term.  I ended up looking through <a href="http://www.immobilienscout24.de/">Immobilien Scout 24</a> (German) and visiting a few of the places listed there, but actually found my apartment in the <a href="http://www.toytowngermany.com/forum/index.php?showforum=25">Classified Advertisements: Munich</a> forums (English) at <a href="http://toytowngermany.com/">Toy Town Germany</a>.  Check those out if you’re in the market.</p>
