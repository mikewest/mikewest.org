I"’!<p>Like most people with personal websites, Iâ€™m hugely interested in my stats.  This is fairly laughable, given the hugely unimpressive number of hits I get a day, but Iâ€™m interested regardless.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I care about two things: whoâ€™s pointing to my posts (referrers), and how many people are hitting the site (visits).  <a href="http://technorati.com/search/mikewest.org" title="Technorati Search: 'mikewest.org'">Egosurfing Technorati</a> is a nice way of getting some of this information, but it just doesnâ€™t feel very accurate, and it simply canâ€™t be as detailed as some other solutions that actually integrate themselves into your site.  Letâ€™s talk about one of those that Iâ€™ve found useful: <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/">Shaun Inman</a>â€™s <a href="http://haveamint.com/" title="Mint: A Fresh Look at Your Site">Mint</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to elegant display of the ebb and flow of your siteâ€™s current traffic, I havenâ€™t come across anything better than <a href="http://haveamint.com/" title="Mint: A Fresh Look at Your Site">Mint</a>.  In itâ€™s default configuration, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a robust solution for high-traffic sites (loading the dashboard alone practically tanks <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/" title="Digital Web Magazine">Digital Web</a>â€™s server), but itâ€™s pure magic for a personal site like this one.</p>

<p>Out of the box, <a href="http://haveamint.com/" title="Mint: A Fresh Look at Your Site">Mint</a> gathers and presents several bits of information that I care about.  Adding a few key plugins, or â€œPeppersâ€ (Pepper.  Mint.  Peppermint.  Oh that clever guyâ€¦), expands the default functionality to encompass almost everything else I care about.  In fact, <a href="http://haveamint.com/forum/" title="Mint Support Forum">the community</a> thatâ€™s sprung up around Mint is really the reason Mint is worth the $30 to me.  The high level of interest and interaction practically ensures that a Pepper will spring up when a new idea floats around for improving analysis (<a href="http://www.massiveblue.net/pepperminttea/">Peppermint Tea</a> gathers these plugins together in a decent way, so theyâ€™re always fairly easy to find).</p>

<h2 id="aggregate-numbers">Aggregate Numbers</h2>

<p>Mint gives me a lot of insight into the current patterns of traffic on my site.  Specifically, it provides a <strong>day-by-day view of my aggregate hit numbers</strong>.  I like seeing numbers, and the default installation of Mint does a nice job presenting the total number of page views, and a reasonable job guessing at the total number of <em>unique</em> visitors.  It runs via a JavaScript include, and sets a cookie on each visitorâ€™s browser, so Iâ€™m much more confident in this tatter number than I am in the numbers generated by a log analyzer like <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/" title="AWStats - Free Log File Analyzer">AWStats</a>.</p>

<p>The default Peppers are good at displaying the raw numbers, but to really get a grasp on the traffic information, <a href="http://www.sensoryoutput.com/">Kyle Rove</a> has put together a brilliant Pepper called <a href="http://www.sensoryoutput.com/projects/freshview/" title="Fresh View for Mint">Fresh View</a> that renders the totals and uniques as an SVG-based graph.  Itâ€™s <em>pretty</em>, and absolutely increases my ability to <em>analyze</em> the information in a useful way.  Looking at a little dot thatâ€™s twice as high as the previous dot means something to me <em>immediately</em> about my traffic patterns; raw numbers simply donâ€™t have that impact.</p>

<p>More than daily numbers, I find it really interesting to see the trends that pop up when comparing day to day traffic.  <a href="http://brettdewoody.com/">Brett DeWoody</a> and <a href="http://cavemonkey50.com/">Ronald Heft</a> put together the cleverly named <a href="http://cavemonkey50.com/code/trends/" title="Trends">Trends</a> Pepper thatâ€™s surprisingly good at processing the raw traffic data, and presenting useful trending information that you can actually do something with.  I have mine configured to compare the previous 7 days of traffic to the 7 days before that, which gives me a pretty accurate picture of which posts people are reading <em>now</em>, compared to which posts they were reading a week ago.  I get the same information about referrers and searches, all with one Pepper.  Itâ€™s really quite well put together, letting you dive into the information to see the history on a day-to-day basis for closer examination.  Iâ€™m really happy with how it performs.</p>

<h2 id="referrers">Referrers</h2>

<p>Pure traffic numbers are great, and I enjoy seeing my traffic move around and the way that trends pop up now and then, but my <em>real</em> curiosity is all ego: whoâ€™s talking about me, and what are they saying?  <a href="http://adactio.com/articles/1132/" title="Jeremy Keith: 'In Praise of the Hyperlink'">Links are the lifeblood of the web</a>, and Iâ€™m <em>very</em> interested in whoâ€™s sending traffic my way.  Mint, of course, tells me.</p>

<p>Out of the box, Mint captures referrer information, and gives me a list of the newest unique incoming links.  Even better, it gives me an RSS feed of the newest unique referrers, so I donâ€™t have to reload the Mint dashboard every five minutes to feed my data addiction; I just pop open <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/" title="NetNewsWire">NetNewsWire</a> and there they are.  Brilliant stuff.</p>

<p>Of course, new unique referrers arenâ€™t all I care about.  Iâ€™m also curious about the long-term links from more popular pages that just keep driving traffic in.  Mint does collect counts for repeat referrers, but the <a href="http://cavemonkey50.com/code/trends/" title="Trends">Trends</a> Pepper mentioned above fills in the details much more nicely, giving a good overview of whoâ€™s sending traffic <em>now</em> vs. <em>before</em>.</p>

<h2 id="search-results">Search Results</h2>

<p>The last thing I want to see are the keywords and phrases that are driving people to my site.  I want to know <em>how</em> they find me, and what they were looking for, mostly because it gives me ideas for new articles and provides important information about the <em>words</em> that are important when describing certain topics.  If I continually write about unobtrusive JavaScript techniques, but never say the word â€œAJAXâ€, then Iâ€™m missing out on an easy way to optimize my content for search engines.  And when I see that the articles I wrote about <a href="http://mikewest.org/archive/answers-to-common-interview-questions" title="Mike West: Answers to Common Technical Interview Questions'">prepping for technical interview questions</a> are getting some good traffic, itâ€™s an inspiration to write more on the topic.  I <em>like</em> the idea of people <em>actually reading</em> what I write; knowing what people are looking for when they find me is a good step in that direction.</p>

<p>And hey, every once in a while, people search for things like â€œmike west is number 1â€, which I like to pretend is <em>really</em> about me.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

<p>Mint isnâ€™t the only analysis package out there, and $30 is a bit steep for itâ€™s functionality on just one site, really.  So what else might you look at to get some of the power of Mint at a lower price?  These are some that Iâ€™ve used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> is a nice system that Googleâ€™s put out for free. 
Itâ€™s a little obtuse to use, and is really more focused on the needs of
high-end users that want to optimize their ad spend than on the needs of
personal websites.  That said, itâ€™s free, and it really does work pretty
well.  Itâ€™s just not as elegant as Mint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://wettone.com/code/slimstat" title="SlimStat">SlimStat</a> is an analytics engine based on a precursor to Mint:
ShortStat.  Shaun Inman released ShortStat under the GPL before moving on
to write Mint, and <a href="http://wettone.com/" title="Stephen Wettone">Stephen Wettone</a> took off and ran with it, building
in a lot of nice functionality, and building up a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/slimstat" title="SlimStat Google Group">good-sized
community</a> at the same time.  Itâ€™s not as polished as Mint,
and lacks the real plugin architecture that makes Mint so appealing to 
developers, but itâ€™s a solid, free alternative thatâ€™s well worth taking a
look at.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
