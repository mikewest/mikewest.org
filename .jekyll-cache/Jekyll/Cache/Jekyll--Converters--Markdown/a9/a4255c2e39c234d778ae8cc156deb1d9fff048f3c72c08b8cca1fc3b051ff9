I"ï<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">mcw_templates</code> is a TextPattern admin plugin that enables the trivial export of pages, forms, and CSS rules to files in a specified folder for convenient editing, and the subsequent import of new and updated files.  This means that youâ€™re no longer bound to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">textarea</code> inside TextPattern when you work on your siteâ€™s structure and design.</p>

<p>The plugin supports multiple sets of templates, so you can rapidly import a new template, or export your current template for external editing without disturbing templates youâ€™ve exported in the past.</p>

<h2 id="download">Download</h2>

<p><a href="http://github.com/mikewest/mcw_templates/tree/master">Download the current version of the plugin (<strong>0.2</strong>)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update, 2008-10-18</strong>: Iâ€™ve abandoned this project, and released the code under the MIT license.  Itâ€™s <a href="http://github.com/mikewest/mcw_templates/tree/master">up now on GitHub</a> for you to fork at your leisure.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>This plugin is <strong>beta</strong> in every sense of the word, as itâ€™s only been tested on my <strong>4.03</strong> installation.  It might work on other version, but no promises!</p>

<p>Regardless of where itâ€™s been tested, this plugin messes around with your database.  <em>Do not use it without backing up your database</em>.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>By default, the plugin looks for a directory named <code class="highlighter-rouge">_templates</code>
in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">textpattern</code> directory.  If the directory doesnâ€™t exist, the plugin will attempt to create it the first time you export your templates. This creation will almost certainly fail, since the<code class="highlighter-rouge">textpattern</code> directory usually isnâ€™t writable.  In that case, youâ€™ll need to create this  directory, and ensure that the web server has write access.  If your site is hosted at <code class="highlighter-rouge">/users/home/myuser/web/public/</code>, then the following commands    could be used:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd /users/home/myuser/web/public/
mkdir ./textpattern/_templates
chmod 777 ./textpattern/_templates
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>To use the plugin, simply select â€˜importâ€™ or â€˜exportâ€™ from the dropdown on the pluginâ€™s tab (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> -&gt; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Template Files</code>).</p>

<p>When exporting, youâ€™re asked for an export set name, which is used as the subdirectory name.  On import, youâ€™re asked to choose from the export sets available.  Additionally, an export into <code class="highlighter-rouge">preimport-data</code> is run before each import for backup purposes.</p>

<p>Couldnâ€™t be simpler.</p>

<h2 id="credits">Credits</h2>

<p>This plugin is more or less a total rewrite of <a href="http://www.woods-fehr.com/txp/8/link-template-2-file">Scott Woodsâ€™ Link Template 2 File</a>.  His idea was brilliant, I just reworked everything so that it fit into a TextPattern admin plugin, and added a lot of error checking and documentation.  Kudos, Scott!</p>
