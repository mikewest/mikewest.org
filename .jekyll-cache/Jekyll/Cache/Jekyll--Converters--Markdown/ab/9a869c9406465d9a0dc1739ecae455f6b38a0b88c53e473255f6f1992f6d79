I"/<p>I have purchased the largest phone ever.</p>

<p>My new-to-me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treo_600" title="Wikipedia: Treo 600">Treo 600</a> showed up today, and it’s huge.  And heavy.  But it’s a
reasonable (and dirt-cheap) alternative to the <a href="http://mikewest.org/archive/iwant" title="Mike West: 'iWant'">iPhone</a>, especially

be able to sync my address book with my cell phone and carry around <em>all</em> my
numbers <em>ever</em>.  You’ve no idea how valuable that is until you, say, lock

absolutely didn’t do yesterday.</p>

<p>That said: it’s huge.  Did I mention that?  Makes me hope the iPhone really 
feels a bit sleeker…  I’m not even sure the Treo’s going to fit in my
pockets (<strong>Update</strong>: It fit.  And the iPhone’s almost half the thickness… so I’m still looking forward to it).</p>
