I"H<p>I’ve redesigned, and moved the website over to my new friends at <a href="http://textdrive.com/" title="TextDrive">TextDrive</a>, and it’s now running on <a href="http://textpattern.com/" title="TextPattern">TextPattern</a> instead of the homegrown CMS I was using on the old server.  This probably means that everything’s going to show up again as unread in your feed reader…  Apologies for that.</p>

<p>I’ve got nothing but free time at the moment, so I’m working on some articles which you should be seeing in the vaguely near future.  I’ll keep you posted.</p>
