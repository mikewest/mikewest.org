I"þ<p>Yahoo! has decided to close down the engineering team in itâ€™s German office, of which I am (erâ€¦ <a href="http://hasmikebeenlaidoff.info/">was</a>) a part.  Iâ€™m suddenly <em>incredibly</em> motivated to look for new work.</p>

<p>If you happen to know of an exciting web company somewhere in or around Munich thatâ€™s in need of a solid webdev, please <a href="mailto:mike@mikewest.org">drop me an email (mike@mikewest.org)</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mikewest">ping me on twitter</a>, <a href="/resume">take a look at my resume</a> (or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikewestorg">linkedin profile</a>, if thatâ€™s your style), or give me a call ( +49 176 4854 6453 ).  Iâ€™d really <em>love</em> to hear any and all leads you might have.  :)</p>
