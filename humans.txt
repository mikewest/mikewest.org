You'll be shocked (shocked!) to learn that `mikewest.org` was lovingly
hand-built by Mike West, who you can reach via email at mike@mikewest.org,
on Twitter @mikewest, or on Google+ at https://mkw.st/+.

/* THANKS */

Ever so much thanks goes to IconDock for their clever [set of social media
icons][icondock] that I'm using on the site, and to FontSquirrel's wonderful
[@font-face kits][ff], through which I'm serving [Quattrocento][q] and
[Inconsolata][i]. Thanks to [Pablo Impallari][impallari] and [Raph
Levien][levien], respectively, for those typefaces, which are lovely.

Tangentially, thanks to [Henning Hoefer][hh] for suggesting that I write a
humans.txt, which ended up being more interesting than I expected it to be.

/* SITE */

This is a straightforward site, built with HTML5 and CSS3 (but there's nothing
fancy here, other than some background gradients). The site's source is open
and available [on Github][1], as is the site's [content][2].

The site is prerendered into static HTML files via the wonderful, wonderful
[Jekyll][3], with a few plugins I wrote for tag and archive pages. Those static
pages are served to you quickly and easily by Nginx (whose configuration is
also available [on Github][4]). The domain and SSL certificate were purchased
through the lovely folks at Gandi.net, and the site is hosted via the equally
lovely people at Linode.

All the code was written, of course, in Vim (that configuration is also
available [on Github][5]). Pixels were pushed around in [Acorn][6],
